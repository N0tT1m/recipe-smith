Sliced and baked under a blanket of brown sugar, they melt into delectable, ruby-hued spoonfuls, completed with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.\n                                                       Servings: Serves 8 Ingredients 2 pounds rhubarb , cut into 1-inch pieces (about 6 cups)1 1/4 cups granulated sugar1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour1 tsp. vanilla extract1 cup light brown sugar1 stick unsalted butter , cut into small pieces1/2 tsp. saltVanilla ice cream , for serving (optional)  Directions  Preheat oven to 375Â°. To make filling, put rhubarb, granulated sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and vanilla into a 9\" x 13\" baking dish and toss well to combine; set aside.\n\nTo make crumble topping, put remaining 1 cup flour, light brown sugar, butter, and salt into a large bowl and toss well. Using your fingertips, rub butter into dry ingredients until mixture resembles coarse meal. Working with one small handful at a time, squeeze dough together to make a ball, then gently break it into chunks and scatter them on rhubarb filling in baking dish.\n\nBake until rhubarb is very tender and bubbly and crumble topping is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream if desired; spoon any leftovers into bowls and eat cold for breakfast.  \n                                                       \n\n                                                    \n\n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                                        \n                                                            \n                                                            Subscribe to the food newsletter\n                                                            Sign up for the oprah.com food newsletter\n                                                            By entering your email address, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the Privacy Policy.
