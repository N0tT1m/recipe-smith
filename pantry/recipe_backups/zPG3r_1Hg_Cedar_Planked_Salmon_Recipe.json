I found this recipe (already had cedar planks in cupboard). So I went to for it!!I had to substitute powdered ginger unfortunately (I usually have it fresh on hand or diced up frozen). Well, my husband raved (I loved it too), and said hands down it's the best salmon he's EVER had. Ever! That is huge (we're old ...LOL).I did one additional thing. I hated to toss the marinade away so drained it into a small sauce pan and boiled it lightly and used it over the salmon after serving. So incredibly great!!! \n\n \n03\nof 123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \ncbherr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/19/2023\nThis is one of our favorite ways to prepare salmon. I had to improvise on a few ingredients (powdered ginger, red onion, a little balsamic vinegar to get to 1.5 Tbsp total). It still turned out great! \n\n \n04\nof 123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJames\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/20/2023\nI've now made this a dozen times. I always let marinate overnight and sometimes without the onion. Gotta be fresh garlic and ginger root and go without oil, use a 1/3 cup of sesame oil instead. Definitely, Asian component to this dish. \n\n \n05\nof 123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSavvyGum7870\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/04/2022\nSo far the best recipe for cooking salmon I tried.I didn’t have fresh ginger so used 1 tsp of ginger powder instead while keeping the rest of the ingredients unchanged. I kept the salmon skin on, made multiple cuts and placed the skin side on the plank. I also added few slices of Lemon on top. The result was great with many compliments from our guests 😋 \n\n \n06\nof 123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSuzie582\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/29/2022\nThis was super easy \u0026 so delicious! \n\n \n07\nof 123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nGlitzyRoe9980\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/13/2022\nI generally dislike fish and especially salmon, but tried this as part of a diet I am on. It. Was. Delicious. I let this marinade for 2 hours this afternoon (soaked the planks for the same amount of time). Cooked on the center of a Weber gas grill set to medium with a heating plate. The grill thermometer showed 500 F. Set a timer for 14 minutes for a first check and it looked perfect so I pulled it. It was moist, flaky perfection. Highly recommend. \n\n \n08\nof 123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJon\n07/12/2021\n \n\n \n09\nof 123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJosShavaughn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/18/2021\nFirst off this turned out to be some of the best fish I’ve literally ever had I think! I soaked my plank a little over an hour and I think it did fine. I topped the salmon w/ some honey before cooking. I’ll definitely make this again. \n\n \n10\nof 123\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nKen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/14/2021\nThis was “the bomb”!
