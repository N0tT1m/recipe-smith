make in the oven. Plus, this method uses less oil and has easier cleanup. The breaded chicken breasts are baked until golden and crispy on the outside, yet they're still tender and juicy on the inside. Serve schnitzels with lemon wedges and a German-style potato salad.\n\nBy\nChef V\n\nUpdated on November 13, 2024\n\n\n\nTested by\n Allrecipes Test Kitchen\n \n\n\n\nTested by\nAllrecipes Test Kitchen\n \nThe Allrecipes Test Kitchen staff are a team of culinary pros who make and vet recipes using only equipment you'd find in a home kitchen.

You can make it with chicken, pork, veal (wiener-schnitzel), and other types of meat. The word \"schnitzel\" comes from the German word \"schnitt,\" which means \"cut.\"\n\n\n  Baked Chicken Schnitzel Ingredients  \n Here's what you'll need to make crispy chicken schnitzel in the oven:\n\n\n OilUnlike traditional schnitzel, this recipe isn't deep-fried in oil. However, you'll still need to grease the pan with a little olive oil — it'll add flavor and keep the chicken from sticking.\n\n\n Chicken\nChicken breasts are cut in half lengthwise and flattened with a meat mallet until they're about ¼-inch thick.\n\n\n FlourAll-purpose flour works with the eggs and seasoned bread crumbs to make a crunchy, crispy breading.\n\n\n PaprikaPaprika lends a smoky flavor to this chicken schnitzel recipe.\n\n\n EggsTwo whole eggs hold the breading together and helps it stick to the chicken.\n\n\n Seasoned Bread Crumbs\nYou can use store-bought bread crumbs panko, or you can make your own seasoned bread crumbs at home.\n\n\n Lemon ZestThe zest of one lemon adds brightness and citrusy flavor to the crunchy breading.\n\n\n  How to Make Chicken Schnitzel  \n You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this chicken schnitzel:\n\n\n  Prepare the Pan  \n Line a baking sheet with foil drizzled with olive oil. Place the pan in the preheated oven to ensure the pan is hot before the meat even touches it — this will ensure that the breading gets extra crispy during cooking.\n\n\n  Prepare the Chicken  \n Pound the chicken breast halves with a meat mallet until they're about ¼-inch thick. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.\n\n\n  Prepare the Breading and Dredge  \n Make the breading with flour, paprika, eggs, bread crumbs, and lemon zest. Dredge the chicken in the bread crumb mixture.\n\n\n  Cook and Serve  \n Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the pan, then drizzle with more oil. Bake the chicken for five or six minutes. Flip and continue to cook until the chicken is no longer pink. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.\n\n\n  What to Serve With Chicken Schnitzel  \n Chicken schnitzel pairs well with just about anything, from French fries to steamed broccoli. If you need a little inspiration, though, try one of these delicious German-inspired sides:\n\n\n Authentic German Potato SaladGerman Beet Salad with Caraway Seeds\nLengenberg's Boiled PotatoesBraised Red CabbageGerman Fried Apples\n\n\n Explore our entire collection of Side Dish Recipes.\n\n\n  How to Store Chicken Schnitzel  \n Store leftover cooked chicken schnitzel in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat in the microwave or in the oven.\n\n\n  Can You Freeze Chicken Schnitzel?  \n Yes, you can freeze baked chicken schnitzel. Let cooked chicken schnitzel cool completely, then wrap each piece individually in storage wrap. Wrap again in aluminum foil for added protection. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge and reheat in the oven or microwave.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"I made this and it had to be the most tender and juicy chicken I've ever had,\" raves Hannah O. \"I never had a chicken schnitzel before but this was absolutely amazing! I would definitely make it again.\"\n\n\n \"Made this tonight for dinner, and it was delicious,\" says kitsuneluvuh. \"Only changes were a dash of garlic powder in the flour mixture, and some minced garlic in the egg mixture.\"\n\n\n \"I know that when I make chicken like this, I will hear no complaints from the husband or the kids,\" according to Allrecipes Allstar Kim's Cooking Now. \"I only had unseasoned bread crumbs on hand, so I just threw in some seasoning of my own (garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano and dried basil). I loved the method of putting the olive oil on the baking sheet and then drizzling more on top and then baking rather than frying.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

Always good. Love the bake hack with the olive oil. People complained about the smoke. Yes, olive oil is a lower heat oil, but it won’t smoke if you heat the oil during the period of heating the oven up and the taking the sheet out once it reaches the temperature and then add the chicken. \n\n \n03\nof 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLinda Delgado\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/31/2023\n \n\n \n04\nof 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTyrese\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/11/2023\nFamily loved it!Followed recipe exactly and very simple to prep n cookI made a gravy for the biscuits w/ mashed potatoes n mixed French green beans and corn.I bought chicken breast fillets n followed the meat mallet instructions. The coating was JUST enough especially because I did not want fried chicken. Lemon zest was a perfect addition in the piano crumbs I used in the end. Simple ingredients packed a lot of flavor.Thanks for sharing!Well done \n\n \n05\nof 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \ngary weis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/14/2023\nI stayed to the recipe fairy close. It was a very good recipe! Very pleased! I had thin sliced chicken which worked well but I’d try the full chicken breasts butterflied. The next time though, I’d use less oil then in the video and not sprinkle oil on top. Some reviews suggest to cook on a rack (which might help). Next I tried not to over salt and pepper the chicken and the eggs (knowing I was using Italian breadcrumbs) but I think I should have added more salt and pepper. Also I might add a little garlic salt to the flour for a little more added flavor but my wife and I really did love what I made! 👍😁 I’ll let you know next time how it was with my changes. Notice the photo there’s only 4 pieces. It smelled so good we ate two of them before I took the pic! 🤣 \n\n \n06\nof 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nBoston John\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/06/2022\nI was wary of oven-fried chicken but gave this a shot and it was wonderful. I used very thin sliced breasts, and the chicken was cooked throughout, with enough of a crispy outer coating on the outside to make it feel like something more than baked chicken. (I confess I made these in a toaster oven, not a regular oven). The lemony flavor was an added delight - I have never thought of that myself - but that flavor might not have survived a traditional fried chicken.Dish shown in attached photo, with a side of asparagus.Highly recommend you give this a try. \n\n \n07\nof 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nCarolV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/03/2022\nVery good tender with good flavor.

The flavor of the chicken was so good. My granddaughter is already asking me to make it again. They helped me pound the chicken, they really had fun doing that. \n\n \n09\nof 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nBchico Purdiman\n05/04/2021\n \n\n \n10\nof 49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto
