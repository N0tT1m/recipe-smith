They taste just like they came from a fancy French restaurant!\n\n\n  French Crêpe Ingredients  \n These are the simple ingredients you’ll need to make this classic French crêpe recipe:\n\n\n Flour: These French crêpes start with all-purpose flour, which gives them structure. Sugar: Subtly sweeten the crêpes with a teaspoon of white sugar. Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.Eggs: Eggs add moisture and bind the batter together.Milk and butter: Milk and melted lend more moisture and keep the crêpes tender.\n\n\n  How to Make French Crêpes  \n You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade French crêpes:\n\n\n Sift the dry ingredients together in one bowl and beat the eggs and milk in another. Beat the dry mixture into the wet mixture, then stir in the melted butter. Pour or scoop the batter into a greased griddle or frying pan. Rotate the skillet to spread batter out in a thin layer. Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom is light brown.Flip and cook until the crêpe is lightly browned on both sides. \n\n\n  How to Serve French Crêpes  \n Top or fill the French crêpes however you like. Popular choices include whipped cream, fresh fruit, fruit sauce, cream cheese, and chocolate-hazelnut spread. You can also make savory crêpes with cheese, meats, and/or veggies.\n\n\n  How to Store French Crêpes  \n Stack the French crêpes with wax paper in between each layer, then place them in an airtight container or zip-top bag. Store in the refrigerator for up to two days or freeze for up to two months.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n “Cooked to perfection,” raves Stephen Ormsby. “A little bit of batter goes a long way and makes a fluffy crepe ready for filling.”\n\n\n “These were awesome,” says diana alanis. “First time making crêpes and my kids loved them with Nutella. Super easy to make if you follow the directions. I did add one more tbsp of sugar and some vanilla extract. I have made them three times this week.”\n\n\n “Great recipe,” according to Miranda Hooker Alt. “It took a couple tries before I got the right shape for my crêpes, but they had a great texture and flavor. I’ll definitely be making these again. Huge hit for Easter brunch!”\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

I have made these a hundred times and they are always the way I like them. Crepes I like are not sweet (this has a bit of sugar, does not make them sweet) but the toppings are what makes them stand out as sweet or savory. Make sure you cook the first side until brown edges, then flip. Use 1/4 c to scoop out batter and you will have 12 crepes. Love this recipe. \n\n \n05\nof 150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSilvia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/04/2022\nLove it and totally recommend it. Delicious and less greasy. This is a keeper. Nutella in the inside and for decoration and lots of fruit(it feels like I’m eating healthy).

I used 2 non-stick pans to save time and didn't use any extra oil as butter was mixed in ingredients. Medium heat was perfect. I used 1/4 cup for each crepe and quickly angle the frying pan to have the flower mix spreading and even out the whole pan. Photo was my French crepes breakfast, filled with fresh picked strawberries, homemade strawberries jam/syrup and PC chocolate syrup.

The first time, I piped sweet whipped cream into and onto them. The second time I filled them with buttery Carrboro rice and long grain white rice together and served on top of Philadelphia cream cheese and a bit of Smucker's marmalade to make a somewhat sweet, somewhat savory treat. \n\n \n08\nof 150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJaz\n09/11/2021\n \n\n \n09\nof 150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nthalia\n01/10/2021\n \n\n \n10\nof
