Warm and hearty chili with beans that's made extra simple in the slow cooker. This easy chili recipe is the perfect set-it-and-forget-it meal for those busy nights when you want comfort food without the hassle.\n\n\n Be sure to save this recipe because you'll come back to it again and again.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/uGZLxf1QTRctOtThpZrgFK8GVaE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3953159-homemade-chili-Rock_lobster-4x3-1-d7c019338b0e44ddbab8fb8642b5e0fa.jpg\"\nwidth=\"800\"\nheight=\"600\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/PV4MNM__FV49NUNan3u11hpNxDY=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3953159-homemade-chili-Rock_lobster-4x3-1-d7c019338b0e44ddbab8fb8642b5e0fa.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"close up view of Homemade Chili topped with shredded cheese in a white bowl, with a side of chips\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Rock_lobster\n\n  How to Make Chili With Beans  \n You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect from this slow cooker chili:\n\n\n  Brown the Beef  \n Sauté the garlic and onions until the garlic is fragrant and the onions are translucent. Then add the ground beef and cook until browned.\n\n\n  Make the Chili  \n Add the ground beef mixture to the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients. Stir to combine. Set the slow cooker on Low and cook for 4-6 hours.\n\n\n Learn more: How to Make the Best Homemade Chili\n\n\n  When to Add Beans to Slow Cooker Chili  \n With this recipe, you'll add the beans along with the rest of the ingredients (before you start cooking in the Crock-Pot). This will ensure the beans are cooked and tender.\n\n\n  How to Thicken Chili in the Slow Cooker  \n The best way to thicken any chili is to allow it to cook for longer. If you follow this recipe and allow the chili to cook for 4-6 hours on Low, you should be left with perfectly thickened chili.\n\n\n However, if the chili is too thin for you, add a cornstarch slurry to thicken it quickly.\n\n\n  How to Store Chili With Beans  \n Store this slow cooker chili in an airtight container in the fridge for up to seven days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove until warmed through.\n\n\n  How to Freeze Chili With Beans  \n This is a great freezer meal. To freeze, ladle completely cooled chili into zip-top bags and store flat in the freezer. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight. Reheat on the stove or in the microwave until warmed through.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"I like dishes that are quick and easy to prepare as well as delicious to eat. This recipe hits all the marks! The real test is my kids. All of them go back for seconds so it definitely a winner,\" says CraigT. \"Add cheddar cheese, corn chips, and sour cream and chow down!\"\n\n\n \"This turned out so delicious, and I am not an expert cook. I used ground chicken instead of beef, and veggie broth instead of water. I also added one extra tsp each of cumin and chili powder because I like mine spicy,\" according to sarahislam.\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Bailey Fink\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

I love bell peppers so I added 3 chopped. I also added about a lb. of smoked sausage cut into bite size pieces. I do this a lot to my chili as it adds a smokey flavor and increases the size of the pot! Because we all know that the only thing better than fresh chili, is left over chili, that's had even more time to meld the flavors.
