Halibut is perfectly cooked with a flavorful, crispy topping under your oven's broiler. You'll find find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a quick overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated halibut:\n\n\n Mix the first seven ingredients (everything but the halibut) in a bowl. Arrange the halibut fillets in a greased baking dish. Broil the fish for about eight minutes, or until it flakes easily. Top with the Parmesan mixture and broil for a few minutes more, until the topping is golden and bubbling.\n\n\n  How Long to Cook Halibut  \n This halibut recipe should produce perfectly cooked fish in about 10 minutes under your oven's broiler. You'll know the halibut is done when an instant read thermometer inserted into the center reads 130 to 135 degrees F.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/LdCQTV00t5067IqU_3eZfNjBlxg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3767197-05ac78fe615747e2bc759fc7204bb6c7.jpg\"\nwidth=\"960\"\nheight=\"960\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/l70qsSMiGfHdyCjqt7Fwu1tFRs0=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3767197-05ac78fe615747e2bc759fc7204bb6c7.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"halibut on a gray plate with rosemary garnish on the side\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Nigel Tufnel\n\n  What Does Halibut Taste Like?  \n Halibut is the perfect fish to please everyone's palates. It has a mild, slightly sweet flavor with a firm and slightly flaky texture.\n\n\n  Halibut vs. Flounder  \n Halibut and flounder are similar fish varieties (they are both white, mild, and firm), but they're not quite the same thing. Halibut is slightly meatier, while flounder is a bit flakier. However, halibut and flounder can be prepared in many of the same ways. If you can't find halibut, this recipe will work well with flounder.\n\n\n  What to Serve With Halibut  \n Pair this halibut with a side salad for a light dinner, or try it with roasted potatoes or risotto for something a bit more hearty. Since the dish is so simple, though, you can serve it with just about anything. In need of a little inspiration? Peruse our 16 Most Popular Side Dishes to Serve With Fish. Here are some of the recipes you'll find:\n\n\n Oven-Roasted AsparagusBroccoli and Tortellini SaladCaesar Salad Supreme\n\n\n Plus, explore our entire collection of Side Dish Recipes.\n\n\n  How to Store Halibut  \n Place leftover cooked halibut in a shallow, airtight container or wrap it tightly in foil. Store in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat gently in the oven, as the microwave might make it a little rubbery.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"Absolutely that … heavenly,\" raves sbutcher112. \"I did not change a thing. Definitely a keeper. This rivals any of the finest restaurants I have ever eaten at!\"\n\n\n \"This is one of those recipes that is fast, tasty, and easily modified,\" according to Bookbet. \"Any white fish that needs something added works here, even those frozen fillets of fish found in all grocery stores. I now just eyeball the ingredients, always using fresh Parmesan and lemon, and sometimes reducing the mayo or butter to watch the fat content.\"\n\n\n \"This was so dang good,\" says Kelsie Dinsdale. \"I added some dill weed to the sauce and it was perfect for us. My somewhat picky three year-old loved it too so that's a plus.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

The mixture added so much flavor. Husband brought the fish back from his fishing trip to Alaska. It was so fresh.
