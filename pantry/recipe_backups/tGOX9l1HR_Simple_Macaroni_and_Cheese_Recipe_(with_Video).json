Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This simple recipe is cheap and tasty.\n\nSubmitted by\ng0dluvsugly\n\nUpdated on November 21, 2024\n\n\n\nTested by\n Allrecipes Test Kitchen\n \n\n\n\nTested by\nAllrecipes Test Kitchen\n \nThe Allrecipes Test Kitchen staff are a team of culinary pros who make and vet recipes using only equipment you'd find in a home kitchen. Staff credentials vary but include training at the Culinary Institute of America; kitchen stints in fine dining restaurants; and countless hours in the test kitchen itself.\n\n\n\nMeet the Allrecipes Test Kitchen\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n Add Photo\n\n\n\n\n245\n\n\n\n245\n\n\n\n245\n\n\n\n245\n\n\n\n \n\nPrep Time:\n10 mins\n\n\nCook Time:\n15 mins\n\n\nTotal Time:\n25 mins\n\n\nServings:\n4 \n\n\nJump to Nutrition Facts\n\n Jump to recipe\n\n\n\n\n This mac and cheese recipe uses staple ingredients and comes together in just 25 minutes. You'll want to bookmark this recipe for busy weeknights. The good news is, it's so simple that once you make it a couple times, you'll likely have it memorized.\n\n\n  How to Make Macaroni and Cheese on the Stovetop  \n  Step 1: Boil Macaroni  \n Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes.\n\n\n  Step 2: Make a Roux  \n While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese.\n\n\n To make the roux, start by melting butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth. Slowly pour in milk and stir until the mixture is smooth and bubbling. Be careful to not let the milk burn.\n\n\n  Step 3: Add Cheese and Macaroni  \n Finally, the most crucial step: Add cheese! Slowly stir in Cheddar cheese until smooth and melted. We recommend you grate your own cheese because pre-shredded cheese won't incorporate into the mixture as well as block cheese.\n\n\n Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.\n\n\n  Can You Bake This Mac and Cheese?  \n This stovetop mac and cheese is all about convenience, but if you find yourself with some extra time and a desire for bubbly, baked mac and cheese, you can bake this recipe.\n\n\n To do so, complete the first three steps above, then top with any desired toppings such as bread crumbs, Parmesan, crushed crackers, etc. Bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 15 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling.\n\n\n  How to Store Mac and Cheese  \n Refrigerate leftover mac and cheese in an airtight container for three to four days. To reheat, stir in a splash of milk or cream and reheat in the microwave or on the stove, stirring periodically.\n\n\n You can freeze mac and cheese for up to six months. Allow the mac and cheese to cool completely, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag, removing as much air as possible. Label with the date and freeze. When you're ready to serve, simply transfer the dish to the fridge to thaw overnight. Reheat as normal.\n\n\n  Mac and Cheese Add-Ins  \n This is a great starter recipe that allows for endless customizations. Here are some add-in suggestions from Allrecipes reviewers:\n\n\n \"I added onion powder, Parmesan cheese and a little bit of cayenne pepper,\" says RRL.\n\n\n \"I always recommend using different cheeses for taste. I use white cheddar and four cheese Mexican blend together,\" says Angel.\n\n\n \"I like to add diced ham and peas or diced chicken and broccoli…\" says Fred Cannon.\n\n\n \"I added yellow mustard and topped with crushed Ritz crackers,\" says Memmere.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"This is a simple and creamy basic mac and cheese!\" says Allrecipes Allstar Christina. \"I used light Velveeta and 2 percent milk with great results. Very easy to put together, and a nice recipe to customize to your own tastes.\"\n\n\n \"Amazing recipe and so creamy!\" raves foto5.\n\n\n \"For a simple macaroni and cheese recipe as the title suggests, this recipe was fabulous!\" says reviewer Karli F. \"I'm throwing out my box macaroni!\"\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

And I already had all the ingredients I needed.I did add spices and ground beef to give it some more flavor.I added garlic powder, cayenne pepper, paprika \u0026 onion powder to both the sauce and the ground beef as I cooked it. I measured with my heart so I'm not sure how much I used of each spice \n\n \n03\nof 245\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTastyBao4784\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/13/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nCrowd-pleaser\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\nKids were sick of KD so I found this recipe on a whim and it's ruined KD for them now cause they just want this now forever :D \n\n \n04\nof 245\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSararas_2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/17/2024\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\nRecipe is great.

I used Italian style blend cheese because it's what I had 2 cups of, and unfortunately, the recipe isn't so welcoming to different cheeses, it also was very thick, but that could've been part of my cheese switch up. But, I did find it to be easily Manipulable, easy to work with and edit. And as a 16 year old with little cooking experience, this was incredibly easy! \n\n \n07\nof 245\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nRobin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/20/2024\nThis will be my go-to!
