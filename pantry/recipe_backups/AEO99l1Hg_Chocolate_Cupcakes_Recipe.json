In just 30 minutes, you'll have rich and moist chocolate cupcakes ready to serve for your next holiday, party, or potluck. Be prepared to have everyone asking you for this decadent chocolate cupcake recipe!\n\n\n  Chocolate Cupcake Ingredients  \n You'll only need a few ingredients to make these chocolate cupcakes, and you probably already have most of them on hand:\n\n\n Cocoa PowderOf course, chocolate cupcakes need chocolate flavor. Use unsweetened cocoa powder for the most chocolatey results.\n\n\n FlourAll-purpose flour will work best for these chocolate cupcakes.\n\n\n SugarOne and ½ cups will be the perfect amount of sugar to sweeten these cupcakes.\n\n\n ButterMake sure your butter is softened for easy beating.\n\n\n VanillaVanilla extract adds a hint of sweetness to these decadent cupcakes.\n\n\n EggsYou'll need two eggs to bind the batter together for this recipe.\n\n\n MilkMilk ensures the cupcakes stay moist.\n\n\n Leavening AgentsUse both baking powder and baking soda for the perfect rise on these cupcakes.\n\n\n SaltA little bit of salt adds a nice depth of flavor.\n\n\n  How to Make Chocolate Cupcakes  \n Making homemade chocolate cupcakes is so much easier than you would expect. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect from this simple recipe:\n\n\n Sift the dry ingredients (except the sugar) together. Cream the butter and sugar together. Then add the eggs and vanilla. Alternate adding the dry ingredients and milk. Beat until well combined. Spoon batter into prepared cupcake cups — only fill the cups ¾ of the way full so they don't overflow in the oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Frost as desired.\n\n\n  How to Decorate Chocolate Cupcakes  \n You can really decorate these chocolate cupcakes anyway your heart desires. We love topping them with buttercream, cream cheese frosting, chocolate ganache, or simply whipped cream. Dress these chocolate cupcakes up even more with sprinkles or other garnishes.\n\n\n Learn more: 3 Easy Ways to Frost Cupcakes\n\n\n  How to Store Chocolate Cupcakes  \n Store chocolate cupcakes in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days.\n\n\n  Can You Freeze Chocolate Cupcakes?  \n You can easily freeze unfrosted chocolate cupcakes. Store completely cooled chocolate cupcakes in a zip-top freezer bag in the freezer for up to three months. Defrost and serve — or defrost, decorate, and serve.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"These were my first cupcakes that I've ever made and I have to say they are amazing,\" raves Sursika. \"They are moist and perfect for every chocoholic. My niece and nephew loved them and I put some rum over the ones for us grown ups.\"\n\n\n \"My 4-year-old daughter helped me make these,\" says Angela Torgerson Breinholt. \"They were easy and delicious! I will definitely be making them again. They turned out so moist and tasted more like brownies than cake.\"\n\n\n \"I usually use a Betty Crocker to help me make cupcakes, but after trying out this recipe I'm definitely not going to depend on her anymore,\" according to Kim Nguyen. \"I topped them off with a cream cheese frosting and coconut flakes...they were a hit!.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Bailey Fink\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

The challenge is that we are staying in a temporary location and I didn't have all of my baking supplies with me..so we set out to try this recipe. Since I didn't have a mixer of any sort,I subbed the butter for 2 1/4 tsp of vegetable oil and we were able to hand stir. We also add cinnamon to most everything so a tsp of cinnamon was added and we used a full tsp of vanilla. These can out delicious....maybe a little dense but my daughter loves them and is quite proud of herself! \n\n \n05\nof 434\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \n121tinkerbell1979\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/07/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nCrowd-pleaser\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\nEasy to make...I doubled the recipe for starters, then I used 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour, used 1 cup milk and 1 cup regular coffee, pink Himalayan salt instead of regular salt, and finally, I used half Stevia and half regular sugar...turned put amazing and the only reason I was able to take any pictures of the cupcakes was because they was still in the oven as the first 2 batches, 12 regular sized cupcakes, 6 jumbo cupcakes was all ate while the last dozen cupcakes was still in the oven...and the rest are disappearing as I am posting this now... \n\n \n06\nof 434\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nCozyPrune4344\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/20/2024\nlol yeah definitely not great (cackling ) \n\n \n07\nof 434\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nsatherton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/28/2023\nAfter reading the reviews I can confirm that they do not raise properly. I fill my cupcakes with a scoop that fills the cups 3/4 of the way. As you can see in the picture, they overflowed. It also took about 30 minutes to cook, not the 15-17 minutes as stated in the instructions. They are not dry and crumbly as some report but they are also not very chocolatey. I don’t think I will make them again. \n\n \n08\nof 434\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nAlper Mizrakli\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/28/2023\nIt's extremely yummy. I did it for my son's birthday and it is delicious. He loved it a lot. Now I am going to do the ganache and put it on top. \n\n \n09\nof 434\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nCaringGrill5994\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/21/2023\nThe cupcakes fell and hardened within 1 hr. Made 18 and they overflowed and never rose. The batter tasted amazing though. Next time I'll try using buttermilk instead of regular milk. \n\n \n10\nof 434\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nPuffyRoast8226\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/01/2023\nGreat recipe just follow
