It'll impress everyone at your table (even the most discerning dinner guests).\n\n\n  What Is Beef Bourguignon?  \n Beef bourguignon (a.k.a. beef Burgundy) is a French beef stew braised in red wine and beef broth. It also prominently features onions, carrots, and mushrooms. The dish has become synonymous with French cuisine and was famously a favorite of Julia Child.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/pKuxBe3XdjvsSZRKbx79h2hEO5o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1188118-d84b915ff4aa4b9bafdfe896edc388b2.jpg\"\nwidth=\"960\"\nheight=\"960\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/v0-EdVMMlY7N4ASnLsFm4FvUY0I=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1188118-d84b915ff4aa4b9bafdfe896edc388b2.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"Beef Bourguignon I\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n catherine.drew\n\n  Beef Bourguignon Ingredients  \n These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated beef bourguignon recipe:\n\n\n · Wine: For true beef bourguignon, you'll need a red Burgundy wine that is produced in the Burgundy region of eastern France with Pinot Noir grapes. Quality counts – make sure you don't use a bottle you wouldn't want to drink!· Brandy: Cognac brandy enhances the overall flavor of this complex dish.· Fresh and canned vegetables: You'll need fresh onions, carrots, and mushrooms. You'll also need a can of tomato paste.· Olive oil: You'll need olive oil for browning the beef and sauteing the mushrooms.· Spices and seasonings: This traditional beef bourguignon is seasoned with parsley, a bay leaf, garlic, black peppercorns, garlic, salt, and pepper.· Beef: This beef bourguignon recipe calls for two pounds of cubed beef chuck roast.· Bacon: Bacon adds even more meaty flavor to this irresistible beef bourguignon.· Flour: All-purpose flour helps thicken the bourguignon mixture.· Broth: Use store-bought or homemade beef broth.· Butter: Sauté the mushrooms in butter before adding them to the meat mixture.\n\n\n  How to Make Beef Bourguignon  \n Making beef bourguignon isn't hard, but you do have to follow a fairly lengthy series of steps. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:\n\n\n 1. Start marinating the meat two days in advance. Chill in the fridge.2. Brown the beef in olive oil until browned on all sides, then transfer to a bowl.3. Sauté the bacon in the same skillet, then move the bacon to the beef bowl.4. Deglaze the skillet with a cup of the marinade.5. Sauté the onions and carrots. Move the veggies to the bowl with the meat.6. Add the flour to the skillet and stir until brown.7. Add the tomato paste, garlic, broth, marinade, and salt and pepper.8. Whisk until smooth, then transfer to the bowl with the meat and veggies.9. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish and bake for three hours.10. Sauté the mushrooms, then stir the mushrooms into the bourguignon.\n\n\n  Nicole's Top Beef Bourguignon Tips  \n \"Don't be intimidated by its fancy name, beef bourguignon is just a classic beef stew,\" according to culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). Here are a few of her best beef bourguignon tips and tricks:\n\n\n · When you remove the beef from the marinade, make sure it's completely dry before you brown it so it can achieve the color you're after (the flavor has already been absorbed).· You'll know the beef is ready to flip when it easily releases from the pan. \"It'll tell you when it's ready,\" says Nicole.· Nicole uses a mixture of cremini and button mushrooms, but you can use whatever mushrooms you like. Don't salt the mushrooms: That will draw out the water, which will create steam and prevent browning.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/jB_ufw42BBUaCFoMQUlFp3jP6Us=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/pW7ZqBCmOUGpqkJ14nGsFGATnCwXElDPyx45IozpRMM-2000-802c6ba61a0c4fa8a1639ac2e5d8a37e.jpeg\"\nwidth=\"2000\"\nheight=\"1125\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/kj5C9wZiKALFQprnR5PbUuodBnM=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/pW7ZqBCmOUGpqkJ14nGsFGATnCwXElDPyx45IozpRMM-2000-802c6ba61a0c4fa8a1639ac2e5d8a37e.jpeg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"beef bourgeon on egg noodles in a white bowl\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Allrecipes Video\n\n  What to Serve With Beef Bourguignon  \n Ladle the beef bourguignon over rice, mashed potatoes, or egg noodles. That's certainly a very filling meal in and of itself, so you don't technically need to add any sides. Of course, a nice loaf of crusty French bread is essential to soak up all that beefy goodness.\n\n\n  How to Store Beef Bourguignon  \n Allow the beef bourguignon to cool completely, then transfer it to an airtight container and store it in the fridge for three to four days.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"It was wonderful,\" raves Julie. \"I didn't have beef broth, so I used a can of consomme. I didn't have Burgundy wine but used a red wine that I had open. I made it a day ahead and then reheated it and added the mushrooms just before serving.\"\n\n\n \"Totally worth the work,\" according to TwinMama+1. \"My first ever Beef Bourguignon. Marinated 36 hours instead of 48 because we forgot to make it Friday evening, but otherwise didn't change a thing.\"\n\n\n \"I followed the directions and this turned out superb,\" says S.E. \"I was worried that there was too much wine, but it all blended well. I served it over garlic mashed potatoes with a green salad on the side.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

Add beef and toss to evenly coat; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days.\n\n\n\n\n For the bourguignon: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).\n\n\n\n\n Strain beef from the marinade and shake off excess; pat dry with paper towels. Strain vegetables and set aside; reserve marinade. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef in batches; cook until browned on all sides. Transfer browned beef into a separate medium bowl; set aside.\n\n\n\n\n Add bacon to the same skillet; cook and stir until lightly browned. Transfer bacon to the bowl with browned beef. Drain the skillet and return it to the heat. Pour 1 cup of reserved marinade into the skillet; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Return this liquid to the reserved marinade.\n\n\n\n\n Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet. Add chopped onions; cook and stir until just tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in reserved onions and carrots from the marinade; mix well, then use a slotted spoon to transfer vegetables into the bowl with beef.\n\n\n\n\n Return the skillet to the heat; stir flour in pan drippings until browned, about 1 or 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and tomato paste until combined. Add beef broth, remaining reserved marinade, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, whisking to remove any flour lumps; pour over beef mixture in the bowl. Transfer beef mixture into a casserole or baking dish.\n\n\n\n\n Cook in the preheated oven until beef is tender, about 3 hours; stir occasionally and add water if needed.\n\n\n\n\n About 10 minutes before serving, melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and sauté until lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes; stir mushrooms into beef mixture until well combined.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/E9nsET5Tpe95HKhm4xwFATy6kSw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1188118-60bd7f2343b04865ae29b56e2b806305.jpg\"\nwidth=\"960\"\nheight=\"960\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/93T_PJmKMJHBNkedxFuIgpwy4GA=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1188118-60bd7f2343b04865ae29b56e2b806305.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n\n\n\n\n I Made It\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n337\nhome cooks made it!\n\nNutrition Facts (per serving)\n\n\n\n458\nCalories\n\n\n29g \nFat\n\n\n14g \nCarbs\n\n\n20g \nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\n \nShow Full Nutrition Label\nHide Full Nutrition Label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition Facts\n\n\n\nServings Per Recipe\n8\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n458\n\n\n\n\n\n% Daily Value *\n\n\n\nTotal Fat\n29g\n\n\n37%\n\n\n\n\nSaturated Fat\n11g\n\n\n53%\n\n\n\n\nCholesterol\n72mg\n\n\n24%\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n638mg\n\n\n28%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Carbohydrate\n14g\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\nDietary Fiber\n3g\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Sugars\n6g\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n20g\n\n\n40%\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n12mg\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n54mg\n\n\n4%\n\n\n\n\nIron\n3mg\n\n\n17%\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n626mg\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

I cheated on the liquor and just used a lovely red blend. But the meat was so tender and the flavor so vibrant. Wow!I did find the sliced onion for the marinade a little awkward and eventually diced them for the casserole. And I found 4 onions and a pound of mushrooms excessive and cut those back.Served on rotini and loved it! \n\n \n03\nof 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLankyBowl9785\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/08/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\nThis recipe is quite a bit of work, but the end result was spectacular! It was so rich and flavorful. I had a bottle of Bordeaux so I used that. I was afraid it might make the flavor too overwhelming, but it did not. I did not use the vegetables that were in the marinade, but chose to only use the fresh, sautéed veggies when I was preparing to bake it. I increased the meat to 2 1/2 lbs, but may even increase it to 3 lbs. I also put in more carrots and added some beef bouillon for more flavor. I otherwise followed all the other steps of this recipe. This is a pretty incredible dish. \n\n \n04\nof 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJohn Adams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/04/2023\nI've been making beef bourguignon for many years now. I never use sliced onions. I either use 8 to 12 small French shallots peeled and whole, or very small brown onions whole. I've never used parsley as it normally has about 4 fresh thyme sprigs and 2 to 4 fresh bay leaves. And mushrooms are either whole, halved or quartered depending on size. After marinating the beef in the wine I strain it and coat it in flour in a ziploc bag before browning. I saute, bacon, garluc, onion and mushrooms, deglaze with wine, add the remaining ingredients and any left over flour. Then add meat and cook for 3 to 4 hours. Slightly different method. But end results are very similar. \n\n \n05\nof 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nflason\n03/13/2021\n \n\n \n06\nof 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nAndrew Gagnon\n10/28/2019\n \n\n \n07\nof 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMama Dukes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/22/2019\nMade this a couple of times and it’s better each timeS.

Went with a garlic mashed / mini red mashed potatoes side. I did use the slow cooker approach but added the fried (mini bell) mushrooms at the end. One of the tastiest stews I have made among several from this site. \n\n \n09\nof 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJessica Minichiello\n01/31/2019\n \n\n \n10\nof 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSuzie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/19/2019\nDelicious.

  "instructions": "For the marinade: Mix wine, sliced onions, carrots, brandy, garlic, peppercorns, salt, parsley, and bay leaf in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add beef and toss to evenly coat; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days.;For the bourguignon: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).;Strain beef from the marinade and shake off excess; pat dry with paper towels. Strain vegetables and set aside; reserve marinade. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef in batches; cook until browned on all sides. Transfer browned beef into a separate medium bowl; set aside.;Add bacon to the same skillet; cook and stir until lightly browned. Transfer bacon to the bowl with browned beef. Drain the skillet and return it to the heat. Pour 1 cup of reserved marinade into the skillet; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Return this liquid to the reserved marinade.;Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet. Add chopped onions; cook and stir until just tender, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in reserved onions and carrots from the marinade; mix well, then use a slotted spoon to transfer vegetables into the bowl with beef.;Return the skillet to the heat; stir flour in pan drippings until browned, about 1 or 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and tomato paste until combined. Add beef broth, remaining reserved marinade, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, whisking to remove any flour lumps; pour over beef mixture in the bowl. Transfer beef mixture into a casserole or baking dish.;Cook in the preheated oven until beef is tender, about 3 hours; stir occasionally and add water if needed.;About 10 minutes before serving, melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.
