Well, they are! This homemade corn dog recipe is the perfect treat for when you can't make it to the fair or carnival.\n\n\n  What Is a Corn Dog?  \n A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.\n\n\n  Corn Dog Ingredients  \n These are the ingredients you'll need to make this homemade corn dog recipe:\n\n\n · Cornmeal and flour: This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour.· Sugar: A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.· Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.· Salt and pepper: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.· Milk: A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.· Egg: An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.· Oil: Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil.· Beef frankfurters: This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.\n\n\n  How to Make Corn Dogs  \n You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make corn dogs at home:\n\n\n 1. Make the batter by combining the dry ingredients, then stirring in the milk and egg.2. Skewer the frankfurters and roll in the batter.3. Fry the corn dogs in hot oil until lightly browned.\n\n\n  What to Serve With Corn Dogs  \n Serve your corn dogs with your favorite dipping sauce and a classic side dish for the perfect picnic or potluck meal.

I cooked two at a time and they were perfectly corny, sweet, crunchy yet soft on the outside.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

I did chill the batter and dry the hot dogs and had no trouble with the batter! If you are not sure how to cool the batter I just put it in the freezer for 5 or so minutes and it worked great. Also I used less oil and just flipped them over about halfway through. \n\n \n04\nof 142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nAmberCane5862\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/08/2024\n\n\n\nMissing something\nSo I just made these moments ago. The batter portion was too small so I doubled it for 18 weenies. I ended up adding about an extra cup and a half of milk for a double batch which ended up being perfect. I understand that ingredients vary like the size of eggs and the grind of the cornmeal but ultimately I would just say be prepared to add a little moisture. I was amazed at the amount of baking powder but as they really did turn out perfect I guess I was wrong! For the last half of the run I added diced jalapeños that I had partially dried from the night before.... WOW! Game changer! Amazing!! I'll try to upload a pic! I gave it 3 stars only because to get 4 I would say the formulation needs to be perfect .......also, consider skewering your dogs and freezing them first \n\n \n05\nof 142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nFancyDate8100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/01/2024\n \n\n \n06\nof 142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nFrance C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/12/2023\nSo good! I haven't had corn dogs in years, and this took me right back to my childhood. The flavor was great, but I had some issues with the execution. First, the batter came out way too thick, so I had to thin it down a bit with extra milk. 375F is too hot for the oil. I used a thermometer to make sure I had the exact temp, and they were browning way too fast, so much so that I had to take the first one out after 1.5 minutes. I lowered the temp to 350F and that was much better. It's very helpful to use a large cup to batter the frankfurters, as shown in the video. \n\n \n07\nof 142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nNiftyPate8588\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/30/2023\nMade this as corn dog fritters. ++Highly recommended!! \n\n \n08\nof 142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMollyR_CA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/05/2022\nFirst time making corn dogs. Just the two of us, so cut the ingredients by half. The first four we beef sausage links. Came out great. The second group of four we Nathan's hot dogs. Also excellent. Simple recipe, very tasty.

Will definitely make again. So easy!I only made them cause my granddaughter wanted them and I refused to buy those over-priced nasty tasteless things from the store.I had leftover batter and fried it up and made critters; also tasty.I ate mine with brown mustard; granddaughter used ketchup.THANK YOU!! 👏🏽🦋💜 \n\n \n10\nof 142\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMannix
