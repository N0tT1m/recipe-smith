The anise-spiked cookies, which are typically square and feature embossed designs, date back to at least the 14th century.\n\n\n  Springerle Ingredients  \n Here's what you'll need to make this simple springerle recipe:\n\n\n Anise seeds: These springerle cookies start with crushed anise seeds.Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the cookie dough.Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.Sugars: You'll need both granulated and confectioners' sugars for this sweet recipe.Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binder, which means help hold the cookies together.Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the springerle cookies.\n\n\n  How to Make Springerle  \n You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make springerle cookies:\n\n\n Make the dough: Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet ingredients in another. Gradually stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture.Roll and stamp the dough: Roll the dough out, then sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Press the molds into the dough and cut each cookie out. Cover and let sit overnight.Bake the springerle cookies: Bake the cookies in the preheated oven until they are golden brown.\n\n\n  How to Store Springerle  \n Springerle cookies are great because they last and last. In fact, the anise flavor develops over time — so it's best to make them in advance! They'll keep for about two months in an airtight container.\n\n\n  Can You Freeze Springerle?  \n Though you can freeze springerle cookies, we don't recommend it (the texture will change and become more cake-like during the thawing process).\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"Love this recipe....I am so happy with the detail on my impressions — clear and crisp,\" says Kindra Loy Lee. \"They seemed to become crisper after baking. I use a pastry brush to brush off excess powdered sugar after they have baked and cooled.\"\n\n\n \"These were great,\" according to greenbabby. \"My mom said they were just like her mom use to make. I did add a little lemon zest because that's the way my grandma used to make them.\"\n\n\n \"They turned out BEAUTIFULLY,\" raves Caroline Victoria. \"They're almost too pretty to eat, but of course you must try them, and are they ever good!!! I love them with Chai tea.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.\n\n\n\nOriginal recipe (1X) yields 48 servings\n \n\n  cooking spray\n\n\n1 ½ tablespoons crushed anise seeds\n\n\n3 ½ cups all-purpose flour\n\n\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n\n\n2 cups sugar\n\n\n4  eggs\n\n\n½ teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n\n¼ cup confectioners' sugar\n\n\n\nDirections\n\n\n Spray 4 cookie sheets with cooking spray; sprinkle with anise seeds and set aside until needed.\n\n\n\n\n Mix flour and baking powder together in a large bowl until well blended. Place sugar, eggs, and vanilla in a separate large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and frothy, 5 to 8 minutes. Gradually stir flour mixture into egg mixture to form a thick dough.\n\n\n\n\n Working with handfuls of dough at a time, roll out onto a lightly floured surface until 1/4 inch thick. Lightly sift confectioners' sugar over dough. Place springerle molds onto dough; press down hard and evenly until the mold's design registers in dough. Remove the mold. Use a small knife to cut around each cookie, and place them 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Repeat, until all dough has been used. Cover cookies with a lightweight cotton cloth, and allow to dry for 8 hours, or overnight. The designs will remain embossed in the cookies.\n\n\n\n\n When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).\n\n\n\n\n Bake cookies in preheated oven until tops are pale brown and cookies are set, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.\n\n\n\n\n Cook’s Note\nThe molds can be hard to find, but check specialty cookware stores and antique shops.\n\n\n\n I Made It\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\nhome cooks made it!\n\nNutrition Facts (per serving)\n\n\n\n75\nCalories\n\n\n1g \nFat\n\n\n16g \nCarbs\n\n\n2g \nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\n \nShow Full Nutrition Label\nHide Full Nutrition Label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition Facts\n\n\n\nServings Per Recipe\n48\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n75\n\n\n\n\n\n% Daily Value *\n\n\n\nTotal Fat\n1g\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\n\nSaturated Fat\n0g\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\n\nCholesterol\n16mg\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n16mg\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Carbohydrate\n16g\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\nDietary Fiber\n0g\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Sugars\n9g\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n2g\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n11mg\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\n\nIron\n1mg\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n19mg\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

I loved them but I never learned how to make them. After she died, we couldn't find her recipe. I've been searching for something close to what she made, and this is it! They came out perfect the first try. So delighted with these - I was actually getting teary after I tasted the first one! \n\n \n05\nof 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nKaraleeG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/24/2019\nThis is my first time trying these cookies and I agree with what most have said.

Went back to oasis pearl and pharaohs gold I got on Amazon awesome! I tried 3 different springerle recipes including martha's- this is the best tasting recipe by far!! And will be my permanent recipe from now on. Taste and texture are the most authentic. Originally i added way more flour however from now on I will add more flour as needed when rolling. - reg flour is best! No need for cake flour or over beating eggs like other recipes suggest I painted mine with luster dust and pinch of anise extract. MIX the extract and dust in a little bowl with small paint brush. Update! 4 th year making! IF you don't want powdered sugar or flour on cookies so you can paint them spray molds with Pam instead of dusting w/sugar. Also I keep additional flour to a minimum for softer dough that way you can just press molds with hands instead of using a mallet. Honestly I didn't even use rolling pin this year I just flattened dough w/ my hands then pressed pam spray molds on. Design stayed put - nice clean cookie to paint! My cookies are the first 7 photos for reference with and without powdered sugar dust. I highly recommended keeping dough as moist as you can and still be able to roll. There's no need to add excess flour your imprint will remain without it! I do notice the imprint is better when I use flour instead of Pam so if your not painting just flour your \"molds\" really good not the dough! \n\n \n10\nof 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nmyoldasskitchen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/18/2017\nUpdate!2019 - I used wilton luster dust in 2018 and it was horrible!

  "ingredients": "Anise seeds: These springerle cookies start with crushed anise seeds.;Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the cookie dough.;Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.;Sugars: You'll need both granulated and confectioners' sugars for this sweet recipe.;Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binder, which means help hold the cookies together.;Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the springerle cookies.",
  "instructions": "Make the dough: Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet ingredients in another. Gradually stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture.;Roll and stamp the dough: Roll the dough out, then sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Press the molds into the dough and cut each cookie out. Cover and let sit overnight.;Bake the springerle cookies: Bake the cookies in the preheated oven until they are golden brown.;Spray 4 cookie sheets with cooking spray; sprinkle with anise seeds and set aside until needed.;Mix flour and baking powder together in a large bowl until well blended. Place sugar, eggs, and vanilla in a separate large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until light and frothy, 5 to 8 minutes. Gradually stir flour mixture into egg mixture to form a thick dough.;Working with handfuls of dough at a time, roll out onto a lightly floured surface until 1/4 inch thick. Lightly sift confectioners' sugar over dough. Place springerle molds onto dough; press down hard and evenly until the mold's design registers in dough. Remove the mold. Use a small knife to cut around each cookie, and place them 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Repeat, until all dough has been used. Cover cookies with a lightweight cotton cloth, and allow to dry for 8 hours, or overnight. The designs will remain embossed in the cookies.;When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).;Bake cookies in preheated oven until tops are pale brown and cookies are set, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.",
