When you roll up the dough and some of the filling oozes out, don't just smear it on the outside. Some of that may drip off in the oven and cause the smoke alarm to go off and also may make the rolls look a bit unsightly. The flavor was fine though. I also melted the butter for the brown sugar mixture and then later tried to harden it up in the fridge. I should have just let the butter soften instead. That would have helped with the rolling of the dough. Will make again. \n\n \n03\nof 720\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nHeather\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/03/2023\nI made the recipe as written.

I checked the temperature of the milk this time and allowed additional time for rising. Next time I will cook covered for 1/2 time as the tops got pretty well done.5 stars! \n\n \n09\nof 720\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nRowdyKnife1813\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/25/2022\nThis recipe is wonderful. First time making Cinnamon Buns ever and they came out so well. Family has asked me to make them a regular item now. Thank you for this!Very easy , I hand mixed the dough with ease.I should add , I made them in an oblong glass dish , cooked 20 mins ! It cooked evenly,, \n\n \n10\nof 720\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nT.S. Holt-McGraw \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/27/2022\nPerfect bake - beautiful rise. I added pecans to my drunken raisins to create a gooey center with a bit of that lovely nutty crunch. I used half the brown sugar called for and added a couple tablespoons of Stevia brown sugar to reduce the calories. Also made a simple icing with Swerve confectionery. This morning's easy and fun bake was impulsively prompted by my morning coffee-hour reading of \"Legends \u0026 Lattes.\" I could smell the cinnamon rolls coming out of Travis Baldree's words on the pages of the book so I had to go make some. Now my house smells like the setting in the book. Allrecipes dot com is always my go to when I want a hand to hold if I'm cooking/baking something unfamiliar. This was a hit. \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll Also
