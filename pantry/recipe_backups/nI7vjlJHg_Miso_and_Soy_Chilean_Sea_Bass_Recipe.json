It soaks up the flavor so much better, and the Chilean Sea Bass can withstand the long marination. I have taken others’ helpful hints regarding the marinade reduction, but found that it’s not needed because it is very flavorful on its own due to long marination. My kids love to eat it with plain sushi rice. My personal favorite is with a side of Orzo pasta tossed with roasted veggies, tomato medley, micro greens, feta cheese, roasted pine nuts, and fresh basil, finished with homemade balsamic vinaigrette! 😋🥰 \n\n \n04\nof 38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLisa Wilkerson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/11/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\nWhoa!!! I was not prepared for how absolutely fantastic this recipe was going to turn out!!! Literally amazing as written. I did not change one thing at all, just marinated my sea bass overnight because I like flavorful food. It was phenomenal. Tasted just like the miso flavor of the Miso Salmon I order at Cheesecake Factory, which happens to be my favorite. I cooked the sea bass on medium heat on top of the stove covered for about 10 mins constantly spooning some of the extra sauce over it and when it was pretty much done, I put the fish inside of the oven on broil for about 6 minutes to give it a nice crispy crust. I made white rice and Brussel sprouts to pair with it . Wonderful. I made extra marinade and have salmon in the fridge marinading in it at the moment. Going to try it tmrw and see how it turns out.

I followed the recipe exactly and marinated for 6 hours. Definitely good suggestions to save the marinade, cook it down and drizzle on top. I had some thick pieces, so cook time ended up being about 25 minutes. Doing this again tomorrow with guests coming over. Plan to sous vide for an hour at 135F after marinating, then finish in oven on broil until there’s a nice brown char on top. I’ll need to marinate over night this time, hope that’s not too long!EDIT: Removed from marinade and vacuum sealed after 11 hours. Put in fridge. Saved marinade. Played golf. Sous vide for 1 hour at 135F. Removed from bag, put on baking pan. Broiled for about 2 minutes, about 6 inches from heat, until brown. Heated saved marinade, put 2 tablespoons on top of each piece.
