Don't be! This crêpe recipe yields perfectly delicate, tender results every time.\n\n\n  What Is a Crêpe?  \n Crêpes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/bpGkxvwsjgiUiPTHXoHklQh9T68=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/16383-basic-crepes-mfs_001-708fcab6cbea4cbe84263252f18dfe4c.jpg\"\nwidth=\"2000\"\nheight=\"1334\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/X9ewDvU5RmS-H1CKH5tFMcxhuDQ=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/16383-basic-crepes-mfs_001-708fcab6cbea4cbe84263252f18dfe4c.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"plates of Basic Crepes topped with whipped cream and berries\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Meredith Food Studios\n\n  How to Make Crêpes  \n Making homemade crêpes is easier than you think. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:\n\n\n  What Are Crêpes Made Of?  \n Crêpes are easy to make with basic ingredients you likely already have on hand:\n\n\n Flour: These basic French crêpes start with a cup of all-purpose flour.Eggs: Eggs act as a binder, which means they help hold the batter together.Milk: Milk adds moisture and keeps the crêpes tender.Water: Water helps thin the batter.Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.Butter: Butter lends richness and moisture to the crêpes.\n\n\n  How to Make Crêpes At Home  \n Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade crêpes:\n\n\n Whisk the milk, water, eggs, and salt.Gradually whisk in the flour and butter.Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle.Cook until lightly browned on the bottom.Flip and continue cooking until done on both sides.\n\n\n  Crêpe Filling Ideas  \n You can fill and top your crêpes with whatever you like! Popular choices include whipped cream, fresh fruit, fruit sauce, cream cheese, and chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella). You can also make savory crepes with cheese, meats, and veggies.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/tTAPN7sc60QAFIkLz8AG_BbaUIg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/8167618-bc270b42467d491e8be7102b4700e691.jpg\"\nwidth=\"1440\"\nheight=\"1440\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/TH3aAKNqug7AZEVobVMcrFLP_84=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/8167618-bc270b42467d491e8be7102b4700e691.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"a plate of four crepes folded into quarters, dusted with powdered sugar with sliced strawberries on the side\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n rackoflam\n\n  How to Serve Crêpes  \n A fun way to serve crêpes: Set up a crêpe bar where everyone can assemble their own creations with whatever toppings and fillings they want!\n\n\n  How to Store Crêpes  \n Stack the crepes with wax paper in between each layer. Place them in an airtight container or zip-top bag, then store in the refrigerator for up to two days. You can freeze the crêpes for up to two months.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"This by far is the best crêpes recipe I tried,\" raves one Allrecipes community member. \"I love crêpes, I am used to the real deal and this is it. I strongly recommend not to make them thick, just remember that you are making crêpes not pancakes.\"\n\n\n \"Such an easy recipe that you can doctor up any way you want,\" according to Sarah \"Wilson\" Arnold. \"I followed the recipe, only added a bit of sugar and vanilla and they are perfect!\"\n\n\n \"Love these and so easy,\" says Kimberly Kays. \"I served them with Greek yogurt, honey, and blueberries.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.\n\n\n\nOriginal recipe (1X) yields 4 servings\n \n\n2 large eggs\n\n\n½ cup milk\n\n\n½ cup water\n\n\n¼ teaspoon salt\n\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n\n2 tablespoons butter, melted\n\n\n\nDirections\n\n\n Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; add flour and butter and whisk vigorously until smooth.\n\n Recipe Tip\nYou can also add all of the ingredients to a blender and process a few times using short bursts until the batter is smooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.\n\n\n\n\n Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/ipV1kLMNB1pof09cqoghVfpEygc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/16383-basic-crepes-mfs_003-f1033a4dbed74bc2b0d465c8de6026e2.jpg\"\nwidth=\"2000\"\nheight=\"2000\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/UFacd3YjFX_NdQ065n6WjgHYNYI=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/16383-basic-crepes-mfs_003-f1033a4dbed74bc2b0d465c8de6026e2.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"an overhead view of two plates of Basic Crepes topped with fresh creams and mixed berries\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Dotdash Meredith Food Studios\n\n\n\n\n Recipe Tip\nRead our picks for the best non-stick cookware to make cooking your favorite recipes that much easier.\n\n\n\n I Made It\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8,327\nhome cooks made it!\n\nNutrition Facts (per serving)\n\n\n\n216\nCalories\n\n\n9g \nFat\n\n\n26g \nCarbs\n\n\n7g \nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\n \nShow Full Nutrition Label\nHide Full Nutrition Label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition Facts\n\n\n\nServings Per Recipe\n4\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n216\n\n\n\n\n\n% Daily Value *\n\n\n\nTotal Fat\n9g\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\n\nSaturated Fat\n5g\n\n\n25%\n\n\n\n\nCholesterol\n111mg\n\n\n37%\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n235mg\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Carbohydrate\n26g\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\nDietary Fiber\n1g\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Sugars\n2g\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n7g\n\n\n15%\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n0mg\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n56mg\n\n\n4%\n\n\n\n\nIron\n2mg\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n115mg\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

Recipe Tip You can also add all of the ingredients to a blender and process a few times using short bursts until the batter is smooth.;Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.;Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot. \u003cimg src=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/ipV1kLMNB1pof09cqoghVfpEygc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/16383-basic-crepes-mfs_003-f1033a4dbed74bc2b0d465c8de6026e2.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"2000\" class=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\" srcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/UFacd3YjFX_NdQ065n6WjgHYNYI=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/16383-basic-crepes-mfs_003-f1033a4dbed74bc2b0d465c8de6026e2.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"750px\" alt=\"an overhead view of two plates of Basic Crepes topped with fresh creams and mixed berries\" /\u003e Dotdash Meredith Food Studios",
