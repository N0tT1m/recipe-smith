Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.\n\n\n\nOriginal recipe (1X) yields 4 servings\n For the Turkey (Enough for 4 portions):\n\n\n2 pounds boneless turkey breast with skin on\n\n\n1 tablespoon kosher salt\n\n\n1 teaspoon herbes de Provence\n\n\n1 teaspoon oil\n\n\n8 slices bacon\n\n\n2 tablespoons salted butter\n\n\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n\n\n2 cups heavy cream\n\n\n  salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\n\n1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste\n\n\n½ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese\n\n\n1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg\n\n\nFor 4 Hot Browns:\n\n\n8 slices white bread, toasted\n\n\n12 slices tomato\n\n\n8 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, or to taste\n\n\n1 pinch paprika, or to taste\n\n\n4 teaspoons chopped Italian parsley, or to taste\n\n\n\nDirections\n\n\n Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n\n\n\n\n Season the skinless side of the turkey breast with 1/2 of the kosher salt and herbes de Provence. Season the skin side with the remaining kosher salt. Place turkey skin-side up into an oiled baking dish.\n\n\n\n\n Roast in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the turkey registers 148 degrees F (64 degrees C), 45 to 60 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n Place bacon on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Remove turkey from the oven and let cool.\n\n\n\n\n Bake bacon in the hot oven until about halfway cooked, 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Stir in flour until combined. Cook, stirring occasionally, until roux smells like cooked pie crust, about 3 minutes. Whisk in cream all at once. Cook until Mornay sauce is thickened and starting to boil, about 5 minutes. Immediately turn off the heat.\n\n\n\n\n Season Mornay sauce with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir in 1/2 cup Pecorino Romano cheese until combined. Add nutmeg and stir briefly.\n\n\n\n\n Cut turkey into thick slices. Pull off the skin.\n\n\n\n\n Stack 2 bread slices on top of each other and trim off the crusts. Cut 1 slice into 2 triangles. Place bread in a small baking dish set on top of a sheet pan. Top bread with 3 slices of turkey. Place 3 tomato slices in between. Ladle 1/4 of the Mornay sauce all over and cover with 2 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese. Sprinkle with paprika; lay the partially cooked bacon across the top. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more servings.\n\n\n\n\n Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.\n\n\n\n\n Bake under the broiler until bacon is crispy and the tops are well browned, about 5 minutes. Place on napkin-lined plates and sprinkle parsley over each dish.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/sNz0b6vqg9GAza_MyMgkz-ISVLE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/5251744-9f0d494116fc4d7d8c02e1d0ca113feb.jpg\"\nwidth=\"5184\"\nheight=\"3456\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/2EtvBVo_ggZhA9Nl1HgSsgeHDQ8=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/5251744-9f0d494116fc4d7d8c02e1d0ca113feb.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  Chef's Notes:  \n Feel free to buy thick-cut deli turkey so you don't have to make the turkey yourself.\n\n\n Substitute Parmesan cheese or a nice extra-sharp Cheddar for the Pecorino Romano if desired. Substitute cayenne for the paprika if preferred.\n\n\n Instead of broiling, you can finish by baking in the oven at 475 degrees F (246 degrees C) for the same results. To cheat, you can cook bacon crisp separately, and just top the finished dish, but I think it tastes better if you brown with the bacon on top.\n\n I Made It\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n96\nhome cooks made it!\n\nNutrition Facts (per serving)\n\n\n\n1280\nCalories\n\n\n85g \nFat\n\n\n37g \nCarbs\n\n\n89g \nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\n \nShow Full Nutrition Label\nHide Full Nutrition Label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition Facts\n\n\n\nServings Per Recipe\n4\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n1280\n\n\n\n\n\n% Daily Value *\n\n\n\nTotal Fat\n85g\n\n\n109%\n\n\n\n\nSaturated Fat\n44g\n\n\n220%\n\n\n\n\nCholesterol\n400mg\n\n\n133%\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n2841mg\n\n\n124%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Carbohydrate\n37g\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\nDietary Fiber\n3g\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Sugars\n5g\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n89g\n\n\n177%\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n13mg\n\n\n14%\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n533mg\n\n\n41%\n\n\n\n\nIron\n6mg\n\n\n34%\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n1136mg\n\n\n24%\n\n\n\n\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

The dish was super flavorful and filling. i will leave off the side bread next time, as the two slices under each turkey slice was plenty. I used the cheese recommended and it was delish- had a salty burst that was like eating at a restaurant. will definitely make again. oh, and we made it without the bacon since i do not eat pork and the dish was still awesome. \n\n \n03\nof 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nPat J\n11/13/2020\n \n\n \n04\nof 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nPat J\n11/13/2020\n \n\n \n05\nof 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nfoxhunterbabee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/07/2020\nThank you Chef John! I made this Hot Brown post Kentucky Derby. The only change I made was to add a pinch of paprika to the Mornay sauce and again to the top of the Hot Brown; furthermore, I did not add any additional pecorino romano cheese to the top of the Hot Brown. The lack of the later addition probably accounts for the non plus of the browning on the top of my dish as it lacked the fat to accommodate a proper brown. \n\n \n06\nof 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nfoxhunterbabee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/07/2020\nThank you Chef John!

It was decadent as is... would have been way to rich using heavy cream. This was fantastic... so good.

The Mornay needed quite a bit of seasoning, and I ended up using at least 3/4 cup of Romano to get it just right. I've never been to Louisville to have the original, so I have nothing to compare against, but the final result was really really good! That tomato is just PERFECT in there. I have a lot of turkey and sauce left over, so I'm going to try a few modifications tomorrow. I think I'll try using toasted rye or pumpernickle bread and slice the turkey a bit thinner and add a few thin slices of ham. Can't wait. I highly recommend this recipe. \n\n \n10\nof 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \ndat1guy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/04/2019\nAnother excellent recipe from Chef John.

I highly recommend this recipe. \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll Also Love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Allrecipes\n\n\n \nNewsletters\n \n\nFollow Us\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nDinners\nMeals\nIngredients\nOccasions\nCuisines\nKitchen Tips\nNews\nFeatures \n About Us\n \n\n Editorial Process\n \n\n Privacy Policy\n \n\n Product Vetting\n \n\n Terms of Service\n \n\n Advertise\n \n\n Careers\n \n\n Contact\n \n\n Your Privacy Choices\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAllrecipes\nis part of the Dotdash Meredith publishing family.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDialog Heading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMntl.utilities.scriptsOnLoad(document.querySelectorAll('script[data-glb-js=\"bottom\"]'), function() {\nvar Mntl = window.Mntl || {};\nwindow.Mntl = window.Mntl || {};\nwindow.Mntl.affiliatePlugins = window.Mntl.affiliatePlugins || [];\nwindow.Mntl.affiliateLinkRewriter.setMappings( {\nDOC_ID: '6781279'\n,SITE: 'allrecipes'\n,REQUEST_ID: 'n4fc76c7875c94f99ac8b937a5ad339c204'\n}\n);\nwindow.Mntl.affiliatePlugins.push(window.Mntl.affiliateLinkRewriter.processLink);window.Mntl.externalizeLinks.init();(function (Mntl) {\nMntl.digioh = {\nscript: null,\nbrandId: null,\ninitialized: false,\ninit() {\nif (this.initialized) return;\nconst brandId = '47b4a4dd-ffd7-43db-8118-8002b7c15352';\nconst digiohFastActivation = 'false';\nconst lightboxJs = digiohFastActivation === 'true' ?

  "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).;Season the skinless side of the turkey breast with 1/2 of the kosher salt and herbes de Provence. Season the skin side with the remaining kosher salt. Place turkey skin-side up into an oiled baking dish.;Roast in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the turkey registers 148 degrees F (64 degrees C), 45 to 60 minutes.;Place bacon on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Remove turkey from the oven and let cool.;Bake bacon in the hot oven until about halfway cooked, 10 to 15 minutes.;Melt butter in a pot over medium heat. Stir in flour until combined. Cook, stirring occasionally, until roux smells like cooked pie crust, about 3 minutes. Whisk in cream all at once. Cook until Mornay sauce is thickened and starting to boil, about 5 minutes. Immediately turn off the heat.;Season Mornay sauce with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir in 1/2 cup Pecorino Romano cheese until combined. Add nutmeg and stir briefly.;Cut turkey into thick slices. Pull off the skin.;Stack 2 bread slices on top of each other and trim off the crusts. Cut 1 slice into 2 triangles. Place bread in a small baking dish set on top of a sheet pan. Top bread with 3 slices of turkey. Place 3 tomato slices in between. Ladle 1/4 of the Mornay sauce all over and cover with 2 tablespoons Pecorino Romano cheese. Sprinkle with paprika; lay the partially cooked bacon across the top. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more servings.;Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.;Bake under the broiler until bacon is crispy and the tops are well browned, about 5 minutes. Place on napkin-lined plates and sprinkle parsley over each dish. \u003cimg src=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/sNz0b6vqg9GAza_MyMgkz-ISVLE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/5251744-9f0d494116fc4d7d8c02e1d0ca113feb.jpg\" width=\"5184\" height=\"3456\" class=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\" srcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/2EtvBVo_ggZhA9Nl1HgSsgeHDQ8=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/5251744-9f0d494116fc4d7d8c02e1d0ca113feb.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"750px\" /\u003e",
