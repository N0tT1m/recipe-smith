Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes.\n\n\n Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try this hash brown recipe. The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish.\n\n\n  How to Make Hash Browns  \n Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy. First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method — either with a grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes until the water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will ensure the hash browns are extra crispy).\n\n\n Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture.\n\n\n Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil, about five minutes on each side.\n\n\n  How to Make Hash Browns Crispy  \n To keep your hash browns crispy, make sure to heat the oil to sizzling before adding the patties and wait until the one side is golden brown before flipping.\n\n\n You can also make your hash browns thinner because they will get crispier and cook more evenly.\n\n\n  What Type of Potato Works Best for Hash Browns?  \n If you care about the crisp, then you should use starchy potatoes, like russets or Idahoes. The only drawback is that the hash browns may be prone to falling apart because of the starchiness.\n\n\n So, if you want your hash brown to stick together easily, then you should use a waxy potato, like new potatoes, Yukon Golds, or red potatoes. These potatoes have more moisture and will stick together in the pan, however, they won't crisp up as nicely as starchy potatoes.\n\n\n  How Do You Make Hash Browns Stay Together?  \n The biggest culprit that's making your hash browns come apart is moisture. You need to make sure the potatoes are dry before adding them to the flour and egg mixture. Whether you squeeze them out in a dish towel or use a salad spinner, get the potatoes as dry as they can be.\n\n\n You can also use a different type of potato if you are worried about the hash browns breaking apart. If you use a waxy potato, they'll stick together nicely, but they won't get as crispy as you might want.\n\n\n Another option is to add more ingredients that will act as binders. Try adding cheese to your hash browns because when the cheese melts it will be like a gooey glue that holds your potatoes together.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"These turned out great! They weren't greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too. Next time, I think I will add salt \u0026 pepper, plus some extra spices, to the shredded potato and egg/flour mixture, just to give it a more intense flavor. This recipe is so easy that I will have no problems just making these hash browns from memory, eyeballing the flour and spices,\" says eiskyjente.\n\n\n \"Unbelievable. About as good as one could hope for. Crispy on the outside, firm and tasty on the inside. And what a flavor. This will be my hash brown recipe from here on out. Make sure that you don't have too much oil in the pan. The hash browns will take forever to brown and may be too greasy for your taste,\" advises Curt McLey.\n\n\n \"My first try at making hash browns. Success. I added sharp Cheddar, a little garlic powder, a dash of oregano, and some green onions. I will keep this recipe and use it over and over.

I added garlic and cheese to mine. Since I used already minced garlic which was wet, I dried it off and added a little extra flour and 1 extra egg \n\n \n05\nof 139\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nRowdyBay1073\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/08/2022\nI added more flour because I added 1/4 cup of Hatch peppers (minced) and they were a hit! My mix was “tacky”, sticky to touch but not gummy, then used a large spoon to dole 2 rounded spoonfuls per hash brown, gently placed in the oil and mashed them in the middle, watched browning and flipped after 4-5 min…Voila! Great basic hash brown recipe. Thanks. \n\n \n06\nof 139\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \naurielphillips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/02/2022\nUsually when I follow an online recipe, I usually read the bad reviews first to get a general idea why they gave low ratings and 'flavor' is whatwas missing for this recipe.If you're like me and need a bit more flavor than salt and pepper then this is what I did.My changes:I diced two small onions one red and one white, with chives, flavor peppers, grated two cloves of garlic and 1/2 inch piece of ginger. Fried them with 1 TSP of oil until the onions became translucent.5 small potatoes and 1 large.Added dried stake seasoning, cayenne pepper.2 flax egg because we don't eat meat (egg)1/4 cup or less of oil for fryingI followed the rest of the recipe. I covered my frying pan with a cover on medium to low heat so the potatoes can cook properly.I used a tablespoon of oil for every four hash brown.And man they are delicious at brunch 😋 \n\n \n07\nof 139\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nBig George H\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/17/2022\nGreat eazy-peazy recipe! Tasted \u0026 looked like restaurant-style hash browns, except better! My only substitutions were garlic salt and I added a table spoon of store-bought minced garlic. I made a big batch since I was using my electric potato shredder. I froze several 'patties' between wax paper for a later quick \u0026 easier B'fast! \n\n \n08\nof 139\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nPinkDaisy368\n01/09/2022\n \n\n \n09\nof 139\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nmufaropoli\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/08/2021\nThe instructions were so easy to follow.
