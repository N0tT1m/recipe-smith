in sausage and bread crumbs, deep-fried for a delicious savory treat. They're a British pub favorite, perfect for family occasions or picnics. We like to make these on Christmas Eve served on a bed of lettuce with sliced tomatoes and mustard for garnish.\n\nSubmitted by\nChasity LeGrand\n\nUpdated on April 18, 2025\n\n \n \nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n Add Photo\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/kncUbmR_JSEW2kRjLgxO_F_-EPQ=/160x90/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ALR-9482-scotch-eggs-VAT-4x3-65057ce05da147d5b2b548fd8a078f55.jpg\"\nwidth=\"160\"\nheight=\"90\"\nclass=\"img--noscript photo mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nalt=\"Plate of Scotch eggs\"\n/\u003e\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n \n\nPrep Time:\n20 mins\n\n\nCook Time:\n30 mins\n\n\nTotal Time:\n50 mins\n\n\nServings:\n4 \n\n\nJump to Nutrition Facts\n\n Jump to recipe\n\n\n\n\n Enjoy traditional Scotch eggs in the comfort of your own kitchen with this unforgettable recipe. \n\n\n  What Is a Scotch Egg?  \n A Scotch egg is a soft-boiled egg that has been wrapped in pork sausage, breaded, and deep-fried or baked. Despite its name, this likely has English (not Scottish) origins. Scotch eggs are commonly served cold at picnics in the U.K. and packaged Scotch eggs are widely available in British supermarkets, corner shops, and gas stations.\n\n\n  How to Make Scotch Eggs  \n You’ll find a full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make Scotch eggs at home: \n\n\n Boil, cool, and peel the eggs. Flatten the sausage, make patties, and wrap the patties around each egg.Lightly flour the sausage layer, then coat with the beaten egg. Roll in bread crumbs.Deep fry the sausage-covered eggs until they’re golden brown. \n\n\n  How to Serve Scotch Eggs  \n Scotch eggs can be served as an appetizer, snack, or side dish. It could even work as a light meal with a fresh side salad! You might also consider pairing it with a dipping sauce for extra flavor or something with a British flair, such as Basic Mashed Potatoes or British Baked Beans. \n\n\n  Can You Make Scotch Eggs Ahead of Time?  \n If you’d like to make these Scotch eggs one day in advance, boil the eggs and wrap them in sausage. Instead of immediately cooking, store the prepared eggs in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Fry them immediately before you plan to serve them. \n\n\n  How to Store Scotch Eggs  \n Allow the Scotch eggs to cool completely, then transfer them to an airtight container lined with paper towels to soak up extra moisture. Seal the container and store in the fridge for up to three days. \n\n\n  Can You Freeze Scotch Eggs?  \n While you can freeze these homemade Scotch eggs for up to three months, we don’t recommend it unless it’s absolutely necessary. The crispy crust will likely become mushy during the freezing and thawing process. \n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n “Fun recipe,” according to loriaprn. “Easier to make than I thought it would be. My family loved them. Quality sausage is important. I added a little onion powder to my bread crumbs. Yum!”\n\n\n “Everyone loved these served on lettuce and fresh tomato,” says Heather G. “I even caught my hubby and 2 kids eating the leftover scotch eggs cold the next morning.”\n\n\n “So easy to make and tastes amazing,” raves Brandy Pallares. “I had never even had a Scotch egg before trying this recipe. I made a quick dip for them that sent it over the top! Mix a half cup of mayo with several dashes of Texas Pete hot sauce.”\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

Took around 5 minutes in the oil to get them browned and then a quick finish off in the oven to make sure the sausage is cooked. Delicious! \n\n \n03\nof 51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nBraveChip4323\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/03/2023\nI loved my Scotch egg. Only made one. It was about the size of a softball. And I ate the WHOLE thing. It was my first but most definitely won't be my last. The recipe was easy to follow and the addition of the video was great. Thanks Chastity. \n\n \n04\nof 51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLisa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/20/2022\nOmg! I had never heard of them before and twice in one week they were mentioned in two different shows. I had to try so i googled and used this recipe. I did cheat a little and used Jimmy Deans original because it was already seasoned and not in casings. It was so easy and Delicious! The egg was perfect and with the sausage and breading it was just over the top! My very picky husband loved it! I'll be making them again. Tip: Go the extra mile and make a mustard sauce. Not really needed but its so darn tasty 😋 \n\n \n05\nof 51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nNina Greipel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/19/2020\nI did mine in my airfryer and now think they would be better fried in oil and baked.

I used 6 eggs instead of 4. (My eggs were kinda small, if I were to use large eggs, the recipe probably won't make 6) I only used 1 8 oz box of bread crumbs and had lots of extra. I also had to add more oil when frying and baked them for about 4-5 extra mins to make sure they were really cooked in the center.\nMy family LOVED them!! \n\n \n08\nof 51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nBen Lockett\n08/15/2019\n \n\n \n09\nof 51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nclanmac5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/20/2019\nFamily loved them! \n\n \n10\nof 51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nDon Boutwell-Olson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/14/2019\nPerfect recipe. I will note that the ingredients are enough for waaaay more than 4 eggs. Also almond flour works in place of regular flour, and they are fat so you need a bigger deep fryer. \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll Also
