Trust us: There's a reason this old-fashioned side dish has stood the test of time.\n\n\n  What Is Corn Pudding?  \n Corn pudding is a creamy side made with stewed corn, butter, and milk. It often features a thickening agent, such as cornstarch, to make the dish extra decadent.\n\n\n Corn pudding originated in the American South and can be served all year long, but it's frequently associated with Thanksgiving.\n\n\n  How to Make Corn Pudding  \n You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this old-fashioned corn pudding casserole:\n\n\n 1. Whisk the eggs, then whisk in the milk, butter, sugar, and cornstarch.2. Stir in the drained canned whole kernel corn and cream-style corn.3. Pour mixture into the prepared casserole dish and bake until golden brown.\n\n\n  How to Store Corn Pudding  \n Allow the corn pudding casserole to cool, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to five days. Reheat until warmed through in the oven or in the microwave.\n\n\n  Can You Freeze Corn Pudding?  \n Yes, you can freeze corn pudding for up to three months (though since it is dairy-rich, the texture may change a bit during the thawing process).\n\n\n If you plan to freeze corn pudding, it's best to cook it in a foil pan. Allow it to cool completely, then wrap the whole pan tightly in storage wrap. Wrap it tightly again in at least one layer of aluminum foil.\n\n\n Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat until warmed through in the oven or in the microwave.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it,\" raves Lisa. \"Now, I am asked to make it for every family function! Quick, easy, and inexpensive to make! You won't have any leftovers!\"\n\n\n \"This is my favorite holiday dish,\" says Kimberly Conkling Brown. \"Sometimes I even eat the leftovers for breakfast! Here's a tip: Dissolve the cornstarch in milk before adding it to the rest of the ingredients to avoid clumping.\"\n\n\n \"This was a big hit at our family dinner,\" according to Donna Corea. \"I made it a head of time and reheated for the dinner. It was yummy! Every morsel was eaten. I have added it to my holiday recipes.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

Unfortunately I lost the recipe and hadn't made one since, until recently, after finding your recipe. I wanted to present something different on our table for Canadian Thanksgiving this year. Your recipe was exactly as I had remembered it many moons ago. Delicious and easy to make. It must have been a big hit as my crowd lapped it up, and many asked for the recipe. Thank you. \n\n \n05\nof 119\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nEvlpenguin35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/23/2024\n\n\n\nOK with tweaks\nI made this recipe because I couldn't stop singing \"Corn Pudding\" from Schmigadoon to the point I started googling recipies \u0026 driving my family mad by listening to the song quite a bit. Lol if you haven't seen the show, it's on Apple TV and it's hilarious.So to the review...I had some leftover fresh corn that I had boiled a couple days for a previous dinner. I shucked the kernels of 4 small ears and it was plenty. Very delicious but a little watery. Maybe I'll try and cook it a little longer next time. This could be moisture retained by the boiled corn.When I served it with grilled chicken \u0026 steamed broccoli, I added a pad of butter on top and added a little salt \u0026 pepper to taste. It was like eating a custardy corn on the cob.In the words of the Schmigadoon ensamble sings at the end of the song....YUM!!!!! \n\n \n06\nof 119\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nKetrina Harmon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/09/2024\n\n\n\nOK with tweaks\n\n\n\nNeeds more flavor\nFirst time I made this, I made it exactly to recipe. I felt it had too many eggs and I felt something was missing. I rarely use cornstarch even though it’s great for puddings, custards, and gravies. My Mom said the basics are there but just need tweaking. So, I know you can substitute flour for cornstarch so that’s what I did. I used flour, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, salt and evaporated milk. I saw someone commented to add vanilla extract but I might try that another time just for added flavor. Time wise, My Mom said to pull it out of the oven when it hardly shakes and has browned edges. Tastes amazing and the consistency is perfect. My Mom is heading over for the other pan. 😋 \n\n \n07\nof 119\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMarsha Frisby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/06/2024\n \n\n \n08\nof 119\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTwistyJam3162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/03/2024\nThe recipe was good. I substituted Jiffy cornbread mix instead of cornstarch and that was even better! Five stars after the change.
