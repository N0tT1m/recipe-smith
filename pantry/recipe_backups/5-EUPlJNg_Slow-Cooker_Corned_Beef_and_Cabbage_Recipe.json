Wonderful and the Murphy \u0026 Davids brand of corned beef I got from Texas based HEB grocery was not salty at all...actually added salt...lol..I used same amount of water and more beer just because what am I gonna do with the rest of the can since I don't really drink beer and quite frankly it took all that liquid to fully cover the brisket as recommended on other recipes. I added half the red potatoes \u0026 carrots to the bottom at the start. Chopped big to avoid mush. I did 4 hours on high, took the cabbage wedges out then added the rest of potatoes, carrots and cabbage wedges. At this point I moved and tried to keep most of the veggies on top since I feared mushy veggies. Cooked for about 3 more hours on high. I meant to turn to low for an hour but later discovered I had turn it off. Lol. I checked the meat and it was pull apart tender so I decided not to turn it back on. I let the residual heat and steam do the rest. \n\n \n05\nof 241\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMarion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/17/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\nAbsolutely spectacular! I have never had luck making corned beef \u0026 cabbage, to the point we switched to ham \u0026 cabbage. I decided to give it another try with this recipe and the only complaint was there wasn’t any more. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Mich Ultra and salt free beef broth…no water. Some of the reviews said to cut it back to low and add the potatoes \u0026 carrots, then turn it up to high the last hour when I added the cabbage. This is the absolute best recipe and definitely a keeper! \n\n \n06\nof 241\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nCleverOats5792\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/17/2024\nTrying this recipe for the first time .

This was try #3 to make the best corned beef. The first two times, we tried different recipes and both came out dry, tough and salty. This one absolutely melts in your mouth. All I can do is plead with all fellow doubters to TRUST, TRUST, TRUST. High temp is NOT crazy. 8 hours is NOT too long. Guinness Extra Stout is NOT too strong. Water is NOT the wrong liquid. Vegetables will NOT be mush (just cut them larger to ensure it). To the top of the meat, we added all the spices called for (except salt) as if we were pre-brining the meat ourselves (peppercorns, juniper berries, pickling spice, caraway seed, garlic, ground cloves, bay leaves, etc.). Cut with the grain, it falls apart in beautiful shreds. Cut against the grain, it melts in your mouth. \n\n \n08\nof 241\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTerri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/02/2023\nI made it using Budweiser beer and I cooked it on low for 8 hours. I felt the low allowed the meat to become softer and the vegetables to be tastier. I really cook anything on high in the Crock-Pot especially meats. But did enjoy it \n\n \n09\nof 241\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSarah Jo Cross\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/26/2023\nPerfect and delicious! I used a skunky beer, and 2 cups of hot beef broth (added when adding the potatoes). Cooked the brisket on low 7 hours, potatoes for 4 hours and halved Brussel spouts for 2 hours. \n\n \n10\nof 241\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nvicki936\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/22/2022\nUsed a 3.5 lb flat corned beef brisket from HEB - Murphy \u0026 David's corned beef brisket1 1.5 lb bag of baby red potatoes, halved (entire bag)1 onion, sliced thickly and placed in the bottom first4 thick carrots, cut into large chunkshalf can of Shiner Bockfollowed recipe to a T - set crockpot on High for 8 hrs.chopped cabbage and added after 7 hoursMeat was good, not falling apart and I was able to slice. Did not really like the flavor of the broth and veggies. Might like better using beef broth instead of beer. Made a sweet mustard sauce and Irish soda bread to go with it and used the leftovers to make sandwiches the next couple of days. Good economical meals. The mustard sauce saved it for me! \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll Also
