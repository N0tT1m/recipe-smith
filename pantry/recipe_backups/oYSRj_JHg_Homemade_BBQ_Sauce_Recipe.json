Homemade barbecue sauce is delicious, incredibly versatile, and oh-so easy to make with pantry staples. Trust us — you're going to want to bookmark this top-rated recipe for classic barbecue sauce.\n\n\n  What Is Barbecue Sauce Made Of?  \n Here's what you'll need to make the homemade BBQ sauce of your dreams:\n\n\n KetchupEvery red barbecue sauce starts with a tomato base. In this recipe, ketchup makes a fantastic foundation.\n\n\n Brown SugarClassic barbecue sauce gets its signature sweetness from brown sugar.\n\n\n VinegarAcidic red wine vinegar balances out the sweet brown sugar.\n\n\n WaterThis recipe calls for a ½ cup of water, but you can use more or less to reach the consistency you desire.\n\n\n Spices and SeasoningsCreate the perfect flavor with Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard, paprika, salt, and black pepper.\n\n\n Hot SauceTurn up the heat with a few dashes of hot pepper sauce, such as Frank's or Crystal.\n\n\nA Field Guide to American Barbecue\n\n\n  How to Make Barbecue Sauce  \n Making homemade barbecue sauce is as simple as blending all the ingredients until smooth. You don't have to cook this barbecue sauce. However, if the uncooked sauce is runnier than you'd like, recipe creator JRNEUMILLER suggests bringing it to a boil and cooking for about a minute. This will thicken the sauce and create a more intense flavor.\n\n\n Find the full recipe with step-by-step directions below.\n\n\n  What Can You Do With Barbecue Sauce?  \n The better question: What can't you do with barbecue sauce? Slather it on ribs, toss it with pulled pork, spread it on your sandwich or burger, or use it as a dipping sauce for fries or chicken fingers.\n\n\n If you're in need of some mouthwatering inspiration, try one of these recipes that put barbecue sauce to good use:\n\n\n Slow Cooker BarbecueBBQ MeatballsBaby Back RibsBusy Day Barbecue BrisketCreamy Pulled Pork Soup\n\n\n Get more recipes: 15 Ways to Use BBQ Sauce\n\n\n  How to Store Barbecue Sauce  \n Store (completely cooled) barbecue sauce in an airtight container, such as a Mason jar, in the fridge for up to two weeks.\n\n\n  Can You Freeze Barbecue Sauce?  \n Yes! You can definitely freeze barbecue sauce — and you should if you're not going to use it within two weeks. To freeze homemade barbecue sauce, transfer it to a freezer bag labeled with the date. Squeeze out all the excess air, secure the bag, and lay flat in the freezer. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw it in the fridge overnight.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"My family's go-to BBQ sauce,\" according to Janet West. \"I took a couple of previous reviewers' suggestions and added a teaspoon of liquid smoke per 12 servings, and also brought it to a boil when I used it as a dipping sauce (gives it an even deeper color and thickens it a bit more). Other than that, I follow the recipe to a T. Wonderful!\"\n\n\n \"Whole family loved it and, best of all, it was QUICK to make,\" says Karla. \"And I had all the ingredients in my pantry already!!\"\n\n\n \"Wow,\" raves Grady Sullivan. \"I will never purchase BBQ sauce again. I added a Tablespoon of Molasses and brought to a slow boil. Continued to boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Thick, rich and delicious.

Bring to a boil over medium heat and cook for 1 minute. Allow to cool before filling into a resealable container (it will fit exactly into a 32-ounce ketchup bottle). Store in the refrigerator.Cut back on the brown sugar to make it less sweet, or add more Worcestershire for a more \"steak sauce\" appeal.\n\n\n\n I Made It\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,603\nhome cooks made it!\n\nNutrition Facts (per serving)\n\n\n\n43\nCalories\n\n\n0g \nFat\n\n\n10g \nCarbs\n\n\n0g \nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\n \nShow Full Nutrition Label\nHide Full Nutrition Label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition Facts\n\n\n\nServings Per Recipe\n32\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n% Daily Value *\n\n\n\nTotal Fat\n0g\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n278mg\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Carbohydrate\n10g\n\n\n4%\n\n\n\n\nDietary Fiber\n0g\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Sugars\n9g\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n0g\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n2mg\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n11mg\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\n\nIron\n0mg\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n65mg\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\n\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

Will make again and tailor to my taste buds but this was great as it was written!!My Next attempt I’ll try: add little more brown sugar, dial back the black pepper by 1/2 teaspoon and see how it goes.Once again, this was great as written! \n\n \n08\nof 79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSunnyRoast2424\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/17/2023\nBeen making this for over a year. This is the absolute best for barbecuing on the grill, or on hamburgers or meatloaf instead of ketchup!! I put all ingredients in a blender \u0026 blend them for 2 minutes. I omited the hot sauce and added cowboy candy marinade to it in place of water to give it a little more sweet \u0026 adds a little heat. I also use ACV in lue of the red wine vinegar and cook it down at a 5 minute boil, which gives it a bolder flavor, smoother, stickier consistency and gets the tang of the vinegar milder. Family loves it and won't buy bbq sauce from the store anymore. \n\n \n09\nof 79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTimidYeast8126\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/30/2023\nSimple ingredients and absolutely delicious.
