This particular cobbler has over 3,000 five-star ratings, so we're confident you'll be thrilled with the results, too.\n\n\n A warm mixture of sweetened, juicy peaches is topped with a biscuit-like dough and sprinkled in cinnamon sugar. Although it's made from scratch with fresh peaches, this easy peach cobbler is incredibly simple and comes together in just one hour. No fresh peaches? See below for tips on using canned or frozen peaches during the off season.\n\n\n  What Is Peach Cobbler?  \n A cobbler — not to be confused with a crisp or crumble — is a deep-dish fruit dessert with a sweetened fruit filling that is topped off with a biscuit-like dough. The dough may cover the entire dish or be dropped by the spoonful, earning it the name \"cobbler\" for its resemblance to a cobblestone street. It gives you the same fruit-and-pastry combination as pie, but without all the effort.\n\n\n In the case of peach cobbler, fresh, frozen, or canned peaches may be combined with sugar, spices, lemon juice, and cornstarch (for thickening). As with all cobblers, it's finished off with a biscuit-like topping and sprinkled with a cinnamon-sugar mixture.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/kLx2NvCmtxUwJvO4JsSmSv7bbt0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/fresh-southern-peach-cobbler-4x3-allrecipes-video-961c9671f3ee4852baf5655032954301.jpg\"\nwidth=\"4000\"\nheight=\"3000\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/2QUohA_U88xlNjTm9pet8YosV54=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/fresh-southern-peach-cobbler-4x3-allrecipes-video-961c9671f3ee4852baf5655032954301.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"fresh southern peach cobbler in a white bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. fresh peaches in the casserole dish are in the background\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Allrecipes Video\n\n  Can You Use Canned or Frozen Peaches?  \n Although it's hard to beat a ripe, juicy peach during peak season, canned (well-drained) and frozen peaches (thawed and drained) make a great alternative when fresh is not an option. Reviewers say they had success with both canned and frozen peaches:\n\n\n\n\"I used two bags of frozen peaches and it turned out VERY good!\" says reviewer MMCCLOREY.\n\"...I used canned and they turned out GREAT! First time I left some of the canned juice in it, but there really isn't a need for it!\" says reviewer Lena.\n\n\n Recipe Tip\nSubstituting canned or frozen peaches? Here's how to do the math:6-8 medium peaches (~4 cups) = 2 (16-ounce) cans6-8 medium peaches (~4 cups) = 40 ounces frozen peaches\n\n\n\n  How to Pick Fresh Peaches  \n Picking a perfectly ripe peach can seem tricky, but you can rely on three simple sensory cues: look, touch, and smell. A ripe peach will have a golden-hue near the stem, it should give slightly to your grip, and it will have a sweet and fragrant smell.\n\n\n If your peaches aren't ripe, here's the good news: They will continue to ripen with a little patience. Place unripe peaches on the counter stem-side-down at room temperature until ripe.\n\n\n Most folks choose to peel their peaches, but you can absolutely leave the skin on. The skin will soften as it bakes and be far less noticeable once cooked. If you do choose to peel them you can do so one of two ways:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/RFxla6YdaHFOmPvZZYNkoeo1wHc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/51535-fresh-southern-peach-cobbler-ddmfs-step-8-0647-3x4-03f648a2adfb4cc984d41f4ff1a70411.jpg\"\nwidth=\"4000\"\nheight=\"3000\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/s_W6oa2FeAJVieOZau1Ku48FpR4=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/51535-fresh-southern-peach-cobbler-ddmfs-step-8-0647-3x4-03f648a2adfb4cc984d41f4ff1a70411.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"baked fresh southern peach cobbler in a white baking dish\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Dotdash Meredith Food Studios\n\n  How to Peel Peaches—And Do You Need To?  \n\nUse a vegetable peeler or paring knife. It's easier to peel a whole peach rather than a halved or sliced peach.\nBlanch and shock. Start by cutting an X on the bottom of the peaches. Bring a pot of water to a boil and dip whole, unpeeled peaches into the water for about 30 seconds. Then immediately plunge the peaches into ice water. After about 10 seconds, remove the peaches from the water and use a paring knife or your finger to peel the skin away — it should practically peel itself! Learn more about how to peel and slice peaches.\n\n\n  Test Kitchen Tips  \n It just wouldn’t be summer without a homemade peach cobbler, according to culinary developer and test kitchen expert Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). Here are a few of her favorite tips and tricks for a perfect cobbler every time: \n\n\n “When it comes to picking your peaches, you want them ripe, but not mushy,” says Nicole. “And you want to be able to smell them.”While fresh is almost always best, Nicole says it’s fine to use frozen or even canned peaches if you’d like. If she had to pick, though, she advises choosing frozen over canned.You don't have to be precious when you're slicing the peaches, as they'll cook down anyway. It's okay if they're imperfectly cut.\n\n\n  How to Store and Reheat Peach Cobbler  \n While it is best right out of the oven (with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, of course!), cobbler will keep covered in the fridge for up to four days. To reheat, microwave to your desired temperature or bake at 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) for about 20 minutes, or until warmed through.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"Coming from the Peach State, I'm really picky about peach cobbler,\" says reviewer AlliePeacock. \"This recipe is fantastic!\"\n\n\n \"Last summer I also made batches of the filling and then froze it, and had delicious cobbler all winter long,\" says reviewer Travis Halling.\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Melanie Fincher and Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

You can freeze a cobbler, but depending on the nature of the crust, it may become soggy over time. If you prepare your cobbler and store it in the freezer until you want to bake it, the ingredients will remain in much better condition over time and the result will be better. Store a cobbler in the freezer for up to three months.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the best fresh peaches to bake with?\n\n\n \n\"The easiest peaches to work with are known as freestone peaches,\" says Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). A great variety of freestone peaches are Babcock peaches. A freestone peach means the peel with come free easier than from a clingstone peaches. Freestone and clingstone peaches are often advertised as semi-freestone or semi-clingstone peaches.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I keep peach cobbler from being runny?\n\n\n \nBesides the recommended use of cornstarch, there are a few tricks to be mindful of when creating a cobbler that is saucy and thick rather than runny. Using very ripe peaches will result in more juices, so in this instance, you may need to cook the cobbler a touch longer. Also, if you spread the batter over the peaches, rather than drop spoonfuls across the top, there may not be enough space for steam to escape.\n\n \n\n\n I Made It\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7,126\nhome cooks made it!\n\nNutrition Facts (per serving)\n\n\n\n562\nCalories\n\n\n18g \nFat\n\n\n99g \nCarbs\n\n\n4g \nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\n \nShow Full Nutrition Label\nHide Full Nutrition Label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition Facts\n\n\n\nServings Per Recipe\n4\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n562\n\n\n\n\n\n% Daily Value *\n\n\n\nTotal Fat\n18g\n\n\n23%\n\n\n\n\nSaturated Fat\n11g\n\n\n55%\n\n\n\n\nCholesterol\n46mg\n\n\n15%\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n400mg\n\n\n17%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Carbohydrate\n99g\n\n\n36%\n\n\n\n\nDietary Fiber\n1g\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Sugars\n73g\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n4g\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n84mg\n\n\n94%\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n114mg\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\nIron\n2mg\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n146mg\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

My family loved it. The filling - I used two 29oz cans of peaches (what I had on hand), and only used the juices from one can (drained the other can). I also added 5tbsp of melted butter. Yep...5, because butter makes everything butter! And I added 2tsp of Tahitian vanilla. The topping - I doubled it, as many suggested. Used light colored brown sugar, not dark. Regular hot water worked. Instead of the 3tbsp of sugar and 1tsp of cinnamon atop (I was weary of it being too sweet as many stated), I just grabbed a little bit of sugar with my fingers (same for the cinnamon), and sprinkled across the top. I baked it uncovered on 400° (mid rack) for 35 minutes. Perfection!! Next time I will make with frozen peaches, and try it again with fresh peaches (when available). I will continue making peach cobbler like this. It was super easy, and everyone loved it. I also loved the cobblestone look of the crust, which I had never done, or heard of, until seeing your video.
