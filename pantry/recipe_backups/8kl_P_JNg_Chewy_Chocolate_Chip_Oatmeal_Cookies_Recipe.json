Seriously, what's up with people hating on oatmeal cookies? Once anyone tries these chocolate- and nut-packed oatmeal cookies, they won't have another bad word to say.\n\n\n These oatmeal chocolate chip cookies have over 3,000 5-star reviews — and we're pretty sure you're about to add another one.\n\n\n  How to Make Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies  \n These oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are super easy to mix up in a stand mixer or with your hand mixer. Simply cream together your butter (make sure it's soft for easy beating) and sugars. Then add the rest of the wet ingredients, then the rest of the dry ingredients.\n\n\n Mix in the quick oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips by hand so they don't get crushed.\n\n\n Luckily for you, these are drop cookies, so you don't even have to worry about working with the dough. Simply drop spoonfuls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets and bake them.\n\n\n  What Are the Best Oats To Use For Cookies?  \n We know, the oat selection in the grocery store can be quite overwhelming. There's just so many options to choose from. For oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, you should use either quick-cooking oats (like in this recipe) or old-fashioned oats.\n\n\n Old-fashioned oats will give you chewier cookies than quick-cooking oats, if that's what you prefer.\n\n\n  How to Store Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies  \n Store baked cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks. Though they probably won't last that long because you'll want to eat them all straight out of the oven!\n\n\n  How to Freeze Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies  \n You can freeze oatmeal chocolate chip cookies both baked and unbaked.\n\n\n To freeze baked cookies, store them in layers with a piece of parchment paper in between each layer in airtight containers or zip-top bags (make sure to squeeze out the excess air). Freeze for up to three months.\n\n\n To freeze cookie dough, place the dough balls on a baking sheet and place them in the freezer until solid. After the dough is hardened, transfer it to a zip-top bag (with the excess air squeezed out) and freeze for up to three months. When you're ready to bake, thaw the cookie dough in the fridge overnight and bake at 325 degrees F. You may need to add a few extra minutes to the baking time — especially if the dough is still hard.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"These cookies are so good! Crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. I had a lot of white chocolate chips so I mixed in white chocolate chips, then divided the dough and added butterscotch chips to half and chocolate chips to the other half,\" says HISTORYGIRL04.\n\n\n \"After trying many different oatmeal cookies looking for the perfect chewy cookie I finally found this one! I do add some cinnamon and nutmeg because I like some spice in my oatmeal cookies. Perfect,\" raves Shannon.\n\n\n \"These are delicious. Having made oatmeal cookies before, I found chilling them for 20 min before baking prevented the flat cookie. I did not put in any nuts, so my kids could take them to school. Otherwise I followed the recipe and we love them,\" according to Mamabear2017.\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Bailey Fink\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

Both my wife and I, as well as my Marines, enjoyed them. I added a drizzle of melted Lindt almond chocolate, which gave an extra layer of sweetness without overpowering the cookie’s original flavors. The recipe strikes a good balance—not overly sweet, even with the chocolate drizzle—which I consider a plus. Overall, this is a solid recipe and definitely worth trying. \n\n \n03\nof 810\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLauraC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/17/2025\n\n\n\nA keeper!\nI used a smaller scooper for sizing consistency and used mini dark chocolate chips and left out the nuts.

I made half the batch without chocolate chips and it was really good. I froze the batter overnight and baked for 23 minutes as I made it bigger and wanted a golden colour. Crispy edges and still chewy in the middle. \n\n \n06\nof 810\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/23/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nCrowd-pleaser\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\nThis recipe was quite a hit! I was in the middle of baking cookies for an ALF. I had already baked Oatmeal, peanut butter, chocolate chip cookies. But this recipe just looked like a good one that I had to try. But, I wanted to change it up a bit so I substituted Craisens for the chocolate chips since I already the others with choc chips I also added a tsp of cinnamon and used pecans for the nuts. All else was kept per recipe.I noticed that some reviewers complained about the cookies taking too long to bake, tasting too sweet, and spreading and flattening during baking. I started baking Sourdough bread about 3 yrs ago and it was then that I purchased an oven thermometer, an instant read thermometer, and a scale. Those three have changed my life in the kitchen.I have a gas oven which shouldn’t matter (they have improved them over the decades) but things usually bake faster even though the thermometer says the temp is correct.1) For this recipe I had to let them bake 13 min removed them from the oven and let cool on the pan for 5 min before moving the to the wire rack to cool.2) Some commented the cookies spread out thin and stuck to the pan. I used parchment paper and had no issues and by the amount of melted butter on the parchment I can’t imagine them sticking to anything.3) I keep my butter cool before mixing with the sugars. If it gets too warm and melts it can change the texture and consistency.4) I used my digital scale to measure all dry ingredients. Volume doesn’t = weight. I’m wondering if that is why so many had runny, flattened cookies.5) I added all the flour and mixed with a wooden spoon (I don’t have a dough paddle or stand mixer and the dough was quite stiff) just until the flour was combined. You don’t want to over mix the dough. Then I stirred in oats, cranberries and nuts. I used a small scoop and it made pretty sturdy and even dough balls. 4 Dz. Some asked about the oats, I used Publix brand quick oats.This is a straight forward easy to follow recipe and you can change up your “add ins”. Different chips, fruits, nuts etc. the base ingredients I found to be perfect! \n\n \n07\nof 810\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nAllrecipes Member\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/20/2024\n\n\n\nCrowd-pleaser\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\n\n\n\nA keeper!\nQuite easy to make and we will make them again. \n\n \n08\nof 810\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMintBoard7112\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/26/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nCrowd-pleaser\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\nSuper easy recipe to follow!

I was very careful when I waited on the margarine to soften and also mixing the ingredients.
