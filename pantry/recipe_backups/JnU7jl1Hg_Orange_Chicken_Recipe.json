You don't have to go out to enjoy delicious, Asian-inspired cuisine! Over 1,300 Allrecipes community members have rated this recipe 5 stars, so you already know it's going to be great!\n\n\n Have some rice on deck because you won't be able to resist the temptation of immediately biting into this sweet and sticky chicken.\n\n\n  What Is Orange Chicken?  \n Orange chicken is a popular item at Chinese restaurants. It consists of small cubes of chicken that are breaded, pan-fried, and coated in an orange sauce.\n\n\n The orange sauce is sweet with a little tang and a hint of spice. It's mainly known for its orange flavor (as you can guess from the name). It's typically made with orange juice and orange zest to achieve the citrus flavor.\n\n\n  Is Orange Chicken Chinese?  \n Even though you see orange chicken at Chinese restaurants in America, it's not a typical Chinese dish. Instead, it was popularized by American Chinese restaurants — alongside General Tso's chicken, which is also not traditional Chinese food.\n\n\n  How to Make Orange Chicken  \n You'll find the full step-by-step recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making orange chicken:\n\n\n  Make the Sauce  \n Combine all sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then let cool. Once cool, transfer to a zip-top bag with chicken and place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 2 hours.\n\n\n  Make the Chicken  \n After the chicken is marinated, coat it in flour, salt, and pepper. Cook it in a skillet until it's brown on both sides.\n\n\n  Combine Sauce and Chicken  \n Add the sauce to an empty skillet and bring it to a boil. Add cornstarch and water (to thicken it), then the chicken pieces. Let it simmer until everything is combined.\n\n\n  How to Store Orange Chicken  \n Store orange chicken in an airtight container in the fridge for three to five days. Reheat the chicken in a skillet — you may need to add water to fix the sauce's consistency.\n\n\n  How to Freeze Orange Chicken  \n Freeze orange chicken in an airtight container or zip-top freezer bag for up to three months. Let thaw in the refrigerator overnight.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"I made this for my family and got raves. I didn't have any green onions so I left onion out and I cut back a little bit on the red pepper flakes. It was so good. I served it with brown rice and it was perfect. I didn't have any leftovers even though I used 4 chicken breasts. I will definitely be making this again,\" according to Carol.\n\n\n \"Delicious!\" raves elcue. \"Made as written, plus a spoonful of OJ concentrate because we like bold flavor. Marinated the chicken for about 4 hours. Thanks to the cook who suggested pouring the sauce over the chicken when serving. None of the coating fell off!\"\n\n\n \"My family, even my 13 year old grandson, loved it. The only change was the marinating for 2 hours. It was a last minute dinner idea and I didn't have 2 hours so I put it in the freezer for 20 minutes and it worked out fine,\" says Firebird91.\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Bailey Fink\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

Although initially sceptical regarding ratio cornstarch to waterI found it good and wouldn’t change. I read other recipes and found this really simple although curious regarding the lemon juice. Our friends gave us a dozen+ fried shrimp which I find difficult to reheat without getting tough, so I warmed and left in hot sauce for a few minute before serving. I only had 1/4 C (almost) brown sugar so used 3 T honey. I love ginger so probably added more ( didn’t measure) and chopped some Rinds dried orange slices, which I recommend and easily sub for zest. Even though the shrimp didn’t have the extra boost from being marinated, it was better than any restaurant dish and I could control extra salt without sacrificing flavor. Really quick sauce, would likely make old shoes tasty. Can’t wait to make again and will add some chopped peppers, diced carrots and broccoli. Although husband doesn’t like chicken, he’ll go for it with this sauce. Wish photo could do justice. \n\n \n05\nof 230\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nAlison Campbell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/22/2024\nI put more chicken in than it called for so it required a bit of extra flour and oil but the sauce ratio was honestly perfect! The zest is 🔑 key 🔑 I subbed rice vinegar with white vinegar, lime for lemon, \u0026 arrowroot for cornstarch. 10/10 would recommend this recipe. \n\n \n06\nof 230\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJason Wiltey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/28/2023\nThis was a big hit with my family! I reduced the sauce a bit before adding any of the slurry and the orange flavor was intense. I topped with some toasted sesame seeds and made some \"Mall Fried Rice\" to go with, and it was like I was in the food court. \n\n \n07\nof 230\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nDREGINEK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/24/2023\nVery good recipe Harry!! Followed exact but used 1TBLS orange concentrate vs juice. Only change - if I could go back, is do in two batches. I saw a reviewer after the fact state that it didn’t get as crispy with the full amount and I have to agree. Served with rice and Stir Fry Cabbage from this site. Would and will make again.

It was so delicious that the people I live with wouldn’t stop tasting it while it was cooling down.A few things I did differently. I used peanut oil instead of olive oil. I highly suggest doing this. Olive oil creates a lot more smoke. Olive oil can catch fire easier. Peanut oil did not affect the flavour in any way.You will need alot more oil as the flour soaks up any oil (whether you decide to stick with olive oil or not). For this reason I would NOT add all the chicken in the skillet at once. Other wise you’ll need to add a lot of oil at one time and that’s not a good idea.As for the sauce when you mix cornstarch in, I suggest using half the cornstarch. I may not use cornstarch at all and see what happens. It was a very thick sauce and I had to add at least a cup of water more plus more when I reheat the food.*Please ALWAYS research how to safely cook with heated oil. Grease fires are scary and very much possible even with people who are more familiarized cooking with heated oil* \n\n \n09\nof 230\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nZachary Kaplan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/26/2022\nReally good flavor, the breading came off and I ended up with more of a chicken/breading/sauce slurry, but I don't really mind it lacking crispiness. Threw a bell pepper in there which I would highly recommend. \n\n \n10\nof 230\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nGutsyRoast1746\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/10/2022\nMade it like recipe said except I used trop50 OJ.
