Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.\n\n\n\nOriginal recipe (1X) yields 6 servings\n \n\n2 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n\n\n4  large links hot Italian sausage\n\n\n6  bone-in, skin on chicken thighs\n\n\n½ pound assorted sweet peppers, seeded\n\n\n4 large Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered\n\n\n1 small red onion, sliced\n\n\n½ medium yellow onion, sliced\n\n\n2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs\n\n\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n\n\n  freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\n\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley\n\n\n\nDirections\n\n\n Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).\n\n\n\n\n Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add sausage links and cook until browned and fat begins to render, about 3 minutes per side. While they cook, lightly pierce sausages in several places with the tip of a sharp knife to release fats and juices. Remove from the heat and place on a cutting board to cool slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n Cut cooled sausages into 2-inch slices; return to the skillet along with any accumulated juices from the cutting board.\n\n\n\n\n Cut two slashes down to the bone on the skin side of each chicken thigh. Halve or quarter any large peppers.\n\n\n\n\n Place chicken and peppers into a large mixing bowl with onions, sausage and juices, Italian herbs, salt, and pepper. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and mix with your hands until all ingredients are coated in oil, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n Transfer mixture to a large, heavy-duty roasting pan. Evenly space chicken thighs with the skin facing up and position potatoes near the top.\n\n\n\n\n Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and everything is caramelized, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with chopped fresh Italian parsley.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/unIpulrb3EScdwVWtzGJr9nwOGs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4086481-chicken-sausage-peppers-and-potatoes-Chef-John-1x1-1-7b01cd012e2e45aa95ba202f2f59e846.jpg\"\nwidth=\"750\"\nheight=\"750\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/BFFK9jm81xKIn-NpYGtBKlPHLIU=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4086481-chicken-sausage-peppers-and-potatoes-Chef-John-1x1-1-7b01cd012e2e45aa95ba202f2f59e846.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"close up view of Chicken, Sausage, Peppers, and Potatoes garnished with fresh herbs in a white bowl\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Chef John\n\n\n\n\n I Made It\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n819\nhome cooks made it!\n\nNutrition Facts (per serving)\n\n\n\n664\nCalories\n\n\n46g \nFat\n\n\n28g \nCarbs\n\n\n34g \nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\n \nShow Full Nutrition Label\nHide Full Nutrition Label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition Facts\n\n\n\nServings Per Recipe\n6\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n664\n\n\n\n\n\n% Daily Value *\n\n\n\nTotal Fat\n46g\n\n\n59%\n\n\n\n\nSaturated Fat\n14g\n\n\n71%\n\n\n\n\nCholesterol\n153mg\n\n\n51%\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n1288mg\n\n\n56%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Carbohydrate\n28g\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\nDietary Fiber\n4g\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Sugars\n3g\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n34g\n\n\n68%\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n56mg\n\n\n62%\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n44mg\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\nIron\n3mg\n\n\n14%\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n548mg\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\n\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

Some people who wrote negative reviews must’ve done something wrong because I have made it as described every time and it’s come out perfect. So flavorful. Don’t hesitate to use a little extra seasoning per taste. If you watch the video of him making it, he even states that. The only thing I do different is use sweet Italian sausage instead of hot because I don’t like anything spicy. I also only use yellow onion, no red. As I type this review, I made this recipe tonight, using boneless thighs since my grandkids would be having some.

Add sausage links and cook until browned and fat begins to render, about 3 minutes per side. While they cook, lightly pierce sausages in several places with the tip of a sharp knife to release fats and juices. Remove from the heat and place on a cutting board to cool slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.;Cut cooled sausages into 2-inch slices; return to the skillet along with any accumulated juices from the cutting board.;Cut two slashes down to the bone on the skin side of each chicken thigh. Halve or quarter any large peppers.;Place chicken and peppers into a large mixing bowl with onions, sausage and juices, Italian herbs, salt, and pepper. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and mix with your hands until all ingredients are coated in oil, 3 to 4 minutes.;Transfer mixture to a large, heavy-duty roasting pan. Evenly space chicken thighs with the skin facing up and position potatoes near the top.;Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and everything is caramelized, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with chopped fresh Italian parsley. \u003cimg src=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/unIpulrb3EScdwVWtzGJr9nwOGs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4086481-chicken-sausage-peppers-and-potatoes-Chef-John-1x1-1-7b01cd012e2e45aa95ba202f2f59e846.jpg\" width=\"750\" height=\"750\" class=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\" srcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/BFFK9jm81xKIn-NpYGtBKlPHLIU=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4086481-chicken-sausage-peppers-and-potatoes-Chef-John-1x1-1-7b01cd012e2e45aa95ba202f2f59e846.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"750px\" alt=\"close up view of Chicken, Sausage, Peppers, and Potatoes garnished with fresh herbs in a white bowl\" /\u003e Chef John",
