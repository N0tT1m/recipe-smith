This beef and broccoli dish comes together in just 25 minutes and only requires ingredients that you probably already have. And if you don't? You can just skip them!\n\n\n This stir fry is packed with strips of beef steak, veggies, and saucy flavors for a weeknight dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made.\n\n\n  How to Make Beef Stir-Fry  \n The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping. Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result.\n\n\n After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds.\n\n\n Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or marinate your beef in one if you prefer.\n\n\n Learn more: How to Make the Easiest Stir-Fry Ever\n\n\n  What Cut of Beef Is Best For Beef Stir-Fry?  \n Flank steaks are the most popular choice for making a stir-fry. However, you can also use sirloin steak, skirt steak, Denver steak, or even beef chuck.\n\n\n Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some extra trimming. You'll want to remove the tough tissue from the steaks before frying.\n\n\n  How to Cook Beef Stir-Fry  \n If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large and have sloping sides that let you cook the entire stir-fry in one pan, so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out. They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less oil.\n\n\n If you can't use a wok (or another carbon steel pan) then any skillet will work. You may just need to cook the meat and veggies in separate batches.\n\n\n When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding your ingredients — they should sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut oil, for the best stir-fry results.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"I added this recipe to my favorites list not even a month ago and I have made this, using different variations every time, at least 5 times. My family loves this recipe and I've paired it with rice or noodles and it always pleases. I usually use beef stew meat and switch up the vegetables. I would definitely recommend this recipe for anybody that's pressed for time and wants to make a quick easy meal that the whole family will enjoy,\" says Tiana Marie Ginorio.\n\n\n \"Hubby and I both liked this. It's very easy to make and is ready in no time. I used flank steak instead of sirloin and I didn't have any green onions, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written. We both though it needed a bit of something, so after the first few bites we added some crushed chilis for a bit of heat,\" adds Allrecipes Allstar France C.\n\n\n \"Made it true to the recipe except that I only used half of a red bell pepper because it was what I had. The dish didn't suffer at all for it and the spiciness was just right for me. Served over rice and was the best quick meal that I made this week,\" raves Shoebox.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

The prep took longer than expected--stir fry always does--but well worth it. I made only two minor changes. I added a bit of ginger root about the size of the tip of my thumb peeled and sliced thinly and some Chinese Five Spice. I also subbed two green peppers for the broccoli as I physically cannot eat broccoli (it's genetic: don't blame me). I will make this again.

I added extra of all of the veggies, also multiple color bell peppers. My only change would definitely need to season the beef beforehand. Just needed a little pinch of salt and pepper at the end. \n\n \n08\nof 209\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nEagerLime4866\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/29/2024\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\nI did add yellow squash, Bella mushrooms sliced and broccoli to the mixture. \n\n \n09\nof 209\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSandyCup3862\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/09/2024\nGreat recipe,loved it. \n\n \n10\nof 209\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLynn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/24/2023\nDelicious!
