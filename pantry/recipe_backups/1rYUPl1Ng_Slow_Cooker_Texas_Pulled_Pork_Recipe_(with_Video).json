You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:\n\n\n  Pulled Pork Ingredients  \n Oil: This pulled pork recipe starts with a teaspoon of vegetable oil at the bottom of your slow cooker. Pork: If your pork shoulder roast is larger or smaller than four pounds, you’ll need to adjust the ingredient rations and cook time.  Sauces: You’ll need bottled barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.Apple cider vinegar: Apple cider vinegar adds brightness and cuts through the other rich flavors. Broth: Use store-bought or homemade chicken broth. Brown sugar: Light brown sugar lends warmth and sweetness. Seasonings: This flavorful pork is seasoned with chili powder, garlic, and dried thyme. Onion: A chopped onion gives the pork tons of flavor. Buns and butter: You’ll need buttered hamburger buns if you plan to make pulled pork sandwiches. \n\n\n  Which Cut of Meat for Pulled Pork?  \n This recipe calls for a pork shoulder roast for a few reasons: It’s inexpensive, forgiving to work with, and tends to have a lot of marbling (which means it’ll result in tender pulled pork). \n\n\n  How to Make Pulled Pork In the Slow Cooker  \n Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade pulled pork in the slow cooker:\n\n\n Pour oil into the slow cooker, then place the roast on top of the oil. Add the remaining ingredients to the slow cooker. Cover and cook until the pork shreds easily. Shred the pork and return it to the slow cooker to combine it with the juices. If you’re making sandwiches, serve the pulled pork on buttered buns. \n\n\n  How Much Pulled Pork Per Person?  \n You’ll need about 1⁄3- to ½-pound pork per person. This recipe, which starts with a 4-pound pork roast, serves about eight people. \n\n\n  What to Serve With Pulled Pork  \n Wondering what to serve with your pulled pork? Explore this collection of Our Best Barbecue Side Dishes. Here are a few of the recipes you’ll find: \n\n\n\nBaked Beans from Scratch\nSimple Macaroni and Cheese\nTraditional Creamy Coleslaw\n\n\n  What to Do With Leftover Pulled Pork  \n Never let your leftovers go to waste!

Here are some of the mouthwatering recipes you can expect: \n\n\n\nCreamy Pulled Pork Soup\nQuick and Easy Pulled Pork Burritos\nPulled Pork Nachos with Sriracha Slaw\n\n\n  How to Store Pulled Pork  \n Store the (completely cooled) pulled pork in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days. You can freeze pulled pork for up to six months. \n\n\n  How to Reheat Pulled Pork  \n To ensure the pulled pork doesn’t dry out, we recommend reheating it in the oven or in the slow cooker instead of the microwave. Make sure to save the juices so you can reheat them with the pork. \n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n “Excellent recipe,” according to kkingsley2. “Very delicious. I added some pepperoncini peppers and a few splashes of Frank's red hot sauce.”\n\n\n “Oh my gosh!! The best I’ve ever had,” raves Jlynn. “Even my pickiest eater ate her whole sandwich and wanted more.”\n\n\n “I've made this recipe multiple times, every time it's amazing,” says one Allrecipes community member. “The only thing I suggest doing is putting in the meat last. So you can properly mix up the ingredients.”\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

I did drain the liquid out of the crock pot and then skimmed the fat off of the liquid. Put the liquid in a pot on the stove and addedh a bit more salt, cayenne pepper, and thickened it a bit with corn starch. \n\n \n04\nof 244\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTracyD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/23/2024\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\nThis smells amazing when you combine the ingredients together.I added a tablespoon or two of some Black Garlic Infused Honey I have, as it is heaven for those can find it.Just waiting for it to finish cooking, I already know I will be making it again! \n\n \n05\nof 244\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSweetGoat9440\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/12/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nCrowd-pleaser\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\nI loved this!

But I had to reduced the liquids in the crockpot as it was all the way to the top of the pot. I read on the web that the liquids should only cover less half the pot. And I had to give room to the natural juices produced by the pork. I am glad I made the adjustment! I also cut the pork so it could squeeze into the 6-7lb crockpot. I saved the extra bbq mixture (warmed) for family to put on their sandwiches. I slow cooked the pork for 14 hours and probably could have been safe at 12 hours. It turned out delicious and was a family favorite on July 4th. You must toast the buns to get that authentic sandwich taste! To complement the meal, I had cole slaw, corn on the cob, mac n cheese, fresh fruit, apple pie a la mode.There were a lot of leftovers from lunch and so my family was very happy about that! Please note that I started to prep the ingredients on day 1 and poured the mixture on top of the pork in the pot at about 8:00 pm. It slow cooked until 10:00 am on day 2 (next time I would stop cooking at 9:00 am). I took the pork out and let it sit for 30 minutes before pulling the pork. It was so tender and well seasoned. I think for 8 adults and 4 grandkids I would think a 6 lb pork shoulder butt should be sufficient if you don't want leftovers. \n\n \n07\nof 244\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nFlimsyUdon4103\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/10/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nCrowd-pleaser\n\n\n\nFamily favorite \n\n \n08\nof 244\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTaffy Holland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/22/2023\nOur small town famous Stantons barbecueBennettsville South Carolina USA 🇺🇸 🛡️ 💋♥️deliciousness ♥️♥️♥️famous pulled barbecue honeys omg deliciousness Southern goodness Barbecue and coleslawWith mixed ginger ale punch drinkOmg deliciousness Southern goodness 🫂🌍❤️ \n\n \n09\nof 244\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nHappyschmoopies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/06/2023\nWe are used to NC BBQ, so, this was different than our norm.

But I did a few changes :) first I rubbed the pork with chilli powder, onion powder, garlic powder , cumin, brown sugar, salt and pepper and I seared the pork!! In my dutch oven :) After that I added all the ingredients BUT not the thyme, no brown sugar since I rubbed already. Half of the broth, half of vinegar and half bottle normal bbq and half bottle honey bbq. 300 for 4 hours in the oven ….DELICIOUS IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!! :))) new addition for our superbowl party! The sauce omg thik and flavoful no need for corn starch !!! \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll Also
