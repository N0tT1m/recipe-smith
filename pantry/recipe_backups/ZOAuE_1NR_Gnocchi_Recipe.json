Gnocchi can be served in tomato sauce, tossed with pesto, or sautéed with butter and herbs.\n\n\n  Gnocchi Pronunciation  \n \"Gnocchi\" can be difficult to pronounce for native English speakers. For future reference, gnocchi is pronounced NYOW-kee.\n\n\n  How to Make Gnocchi  \n You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:\n\n\n  What Is Gnocchi Made Of?  \n These are the three ingredients you'll need to make gnocchi at home:\n\n\n Potatoes: Use starchy potatoes, such as russets.Flour: All-purpose flour absorbs moisture and helps create gluten.Egg: An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the dumplings together.Salt: Kosher salt enhances the overall flavor. \n\n\n  How to Make Homemade Gnocchi  \n Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make gnocchi:\n\n\n Boil and drain the potatoes, then mash or pass through a ricer. Combine the ingredients, then knead into a ball.Divide the dough into four even portions and shape into \"snakes.\"Cut the snakes into pieces.Boil and drain the gnocchi.\n\n\n Test Kitchen Tips\nThis top-rated user recipe was tested in our test kitchen. Here are some tips from the experts:Make sure to rice or mash the potatoes while they are still hot — if you let them cool too much, they can get gluey and be harder to mash. Just allow them cool slightly before adding the flour and egg to prevent the egg from cooking. You can always boil a little tester if you’re unsure if your dough is the correct consistency. If it starts to disintegrate in the water, it needs more flour. If it's tough or gluey after cooking, you’ve added too much flour. Gnocchi can also be sautéed. Boil them until just starting to float, then transfer to skillet with butter or oil and fry until golden. \n\n\n\n  How to Eat Gnocchi  \n Looking for ways to enjoy your homemade gnocchi? We've got you covered! Here are a few of our favorite recipes with gnocchi:\n\n\n\nChicken and Gnocchi Soup\nGnocchi with Tomato Sauce and Mozzarella\nGnocchi alla Sorrentina\nGnocchi with Sage-Butter Sauce\nItalian Sausage and Gnocchi Skillet\n\n\n Explore our collection of Easy Dinners That Start with Gnocchi.\n\n\n  Can You Make Gnocchi Ahead of Time?  \n You can make and cook gnocchi up to two days ahead of time. After you boil the gnocchi, drain it and transfer the dumplings to an ice bath. Drain again, toss in olive oil, and store in an airtight container in the fridge until you're ready to eat.\n\n\n If you want to keep the gnocchi for longer, you can freeze it for up to six weeks. Thaw in the refrigerator.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"The ratio of potato, flour, and egg is the key,\" according to loveyourlife. \"These were light and airy.\"\n\n\n \"Very simple recipe and I made it vegan by using an egg substitute,\" says Barry D. \"I used a cashew sauce on top of it. Very good.\"\n\n\n \"This was really good,\" raves ginabina. \"I actually just made it from leftover mashed potatoes.

It was my first time making homemade gnocchi, and it turned out SO well! It was a lot of work, though, so I’m not sure how often I’ll do this vs. just buying it ready-made. But my husband did say it was probably the best gnocchi he’s ever had. \n\n \n03\nof 110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \npirogimark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/20/2024\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\nThe gnocchi turned out very tender and light with a good flavor. Followed the recipe closely. I used three medium russet potatoes, and when they were tender and peeled, I cut them in chunks and put them through a ricer. I concur that the proportion of flour to potato is spot on, since the dough came together beautifully. Served them in sage butter. I wouldn’t change a thing. \n\n \n04\nof 110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nChristina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/16/2024\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\nSimple, classic goodness! Made as directed with no changes necessary. If the dough feels too sticky, just lightly dust with a bit more flour (don't over-flour because they will become too heavy and that's not good). If you've never made these before definitely give them a try...they are so easy and delicious 😋 \n\n \n05\nof 110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSteadyBeer6301\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/08/2024\nJust made this easy recipe and it's lovely and light!

Since the potatoes need to be as dry as possible, I baked them instead of boiled. The dough should feel like a slightly sticky pizza dough when it comes together. Cut and rolled the gnocchi across the back to a fork and then boiled them in salted water until they floated. Then I just tossed them up in a brown butter sage sauce. \n\n \n08\nof 110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTim Combs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/09/2023\nI really enjoyed the recipe, the gnocchi came out Just right as I used I bit less flour that was called for. \n\n \n09\nof 110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nOrangeOkra5154\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/24/2022\nLove this recipe!!!
