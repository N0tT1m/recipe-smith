Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.\n\n\n\nOriginal recipe (1X) yields 8 servings\n \n\n1 cup white sugar\n\n\n3 large eggs\n\n\n1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk\n\n\n1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk\n\n\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n\n\n\nDirections\n\n\n Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n\n\n\n\n Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour hot syrup into a deep 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom; set aside.\n\n\n\n\n Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture on top of caramel in the baking dish; place in a deep roasting pan. Carefully pour in enough hot water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish.\n\n\n\n\n Bake in the preheated oven until just set with a slight jiggle in the center, about 1 hour, checking after 55 minutes. Keep in mind the flan will continue to set as it cools. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer baking dish to a wire rack; cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming. Refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 3 days.\n\n\n\n\n To serve, run a knife around the edges of the dish; carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate and let caramel sauce flow over flan.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/a6obASEIejSJmFR3Ym4-DEXKNv8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/691985_Spanish-Flan-4x3-7747e8e376af4682ba31f7163d322c15.jpg\"\nwidth=\"2800\"\nheight=\"2100\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/A11TsFV_cQpJd2QLCj_9FkaVnjw=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/691985_Spanish-Flan-4x3-7747e8e376af4682ba31f7163d322c15.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"a slice of perfect-looking Spanish Flan with a caramel top layer and pool of sauce on a square white plate\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n dfdez78\n\n\n\n\n From the Editor\nThis recipe was tested in our test kitchen and updated to include baking the flan in a water bath and not covering with foil.\n\n\n\n\n I Made It\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2,262\nhome cooks made it!\n\nNutrition Facts (per serving)\n\n\n\n406\nCalories\n\n\n11g \nFat\n\n\n66g \nCarbs\n\n\n11g \nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\n \nShow Full Nutrition Label\nHide Full Nutrition Label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition Facts\n\n\n\nServings Per Recipe\n8\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n406\n\n\n\n\n\n% Daily Value *\n\n\n\nTotal Fat\n11g\n\n\n14%\n\n\n\n\nSaturated Fat\n6g\n\n\n32%\n\n\n\n\nCholesterol\n106mg\n\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n162mg\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Carbohydrate\n66g\n\n\n24%\n\n\n\n\nDietary Fiber\n0g\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Sugars\n66g\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n11g\n\n\n22%\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n3mg\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n324mg\n\n\n25%\n\n\n\n\nIron\n1mg\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n420mg\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

I also decided to filter out the eggie bits that wouldn't go completely into the batter to (hopefully) improve the texture and... Oh my god. It turned out PERFECT. Absolutely delicious.

Yet, I tasted the Spanish Flan and it was so moist with great sweetness, but it has slightly less sugar unlike with the Mexican Flan, which that type of dessert takes longer process with ingredients, cooking time, and more sweet with sugar than the European Flan in general. Overall, it was very quick and simple made recipe 😋 👌. \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll Also

Carefully pour hot syrup into a deep 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom; set aside.;Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture on top of caramel in the baking dish; place in a deep roasting pan. Carefully pour in enough hot water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish.;Bake in the preheated oven until just set with a slight jiggle in the center, about 1 hour, checking after 55 minutes. Keep in mind the flan will continue to set as it cools. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer baking dish to a wire rack; cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming. Refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 3 days.;To serve, run a knife around the edges of the dish; carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate and let caramel sauce flow over flan. \u003cimg src=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/a6obASEIejSJmFR3Ym4-DEXKNv8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/691985_Spanish-Flan-4x3-7747e8e376af4682ba31f7163d322c15.jpg\" width=\"2800\" height=\"2100\" class=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\" srcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/A11TsFV_cQpJd2QLCj_9FkaVnjw=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/691985_Spanish-Flan-4x3-7747e8e376af4682ba31f7163d322c15.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"750px\" alt=\"a slice of perfect-looking Spanish Flan with a caramel top layer and pool of sauce on a square white plate\" /\u003e dfdez78",
