I couldn't taste cottage cheese but it did add some volume. The curds melted somewhat and some of them got stringy, but most stayed in little curd form, so it looks like egg white. If you didn't tell people there was cottage cheese in this, I don't think they would know. I'm not sure I am a fan of the chives in this, but I am not a fan of onions anyway. They are okay, but I'd rather not have that odd oniony taste. I might fix this again as it was okay, but I am not an egg fan and this was very eggy in flavor and texture. Yes, it is scrambled eggs, but in an attempt to eat healthier, eggs are an integral part of a low fat, low carb, high protein nutrition plan, and I'm trying all the ways to make eggs to see what I enjoy. Sometimes with the additions they lose some of that eggy flavor and texture, however, this was not one of those egg masking dishes. It was fine, and if you like eggs, then you'll probably enjoy this easy dish. I'd eat it again, but it's not one of my first options for egg. \n\n \n03\nof 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJollyPho3428\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/20/2024\n\n\n\nEasy to follow \n\n \n04\nof 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nFrance C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/27/2024\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\nI really enjoyed these eggs. Not sure why I had never tried adding cottage cheese before, but I loved the subtle creaminess it added to the eggs. It wasn't obvious the cheese was in there, but you could definitely see the eggs were more creamy. This recipe needs salt to bring out the flavors, but otherwise I like it as is. I'll be making these again. \n\n \n05\nof 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nlutzflcat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/16/2024\n\n\n\nNeeds more flavor\nThey definitely are creamy, and the texture is a bit different, not good or bad, just different. I really could taste very little difference with the addition of the cottage cheese. They turned out OK, but doubtful I’ll bother adding cottage cheese in the future. \n\n \n06\nof 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nBraveBeer9517\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/18/2023\nI added spinach, green peppers and tomatoes. Keto diet recommends a lot of greasy meat that isn’t that great for you. Plus, people post keto recipes and rarely add veggies. I guess that’s why keto is so popular.
