Given how easy this is, this was delicious!! A few recommends; first - I went to my deli counter and asked them to slice a lb of corned beef but on the thicker side. I don’t know what a “#4” translates to in slicer worlds but when I cut into bite sized pieces, it was like each bite had a CB brisket I cooked and was using this recipe to use up leftovers. Second, I couldn’t decide on the bread but Pepperidge Farms has a pumpernickel and Rye swirl bread. This is best of both worlds! The loaf itself is a little smaller so used 7 slices. Finding Russian dressing was HARD! Wishbone was the only brand in my store that had it. Although I was skeptical- it WAS really good and I’m glad I found/used it vs Thousand Island. I layered a little differently; bread, meat, sauerkraut, a little Swiss and the dressing. Repeated but a little lighter on all the second go around. Could have used a little more sauerkraut and dressing and will add more next time. Added the rest of the Swiss - and maybe a little more than the recipe called for during the uncovered bake time. Did I mention this was delicious??!! Casseroles - while perfect weeknight meals - are not often regarded as highly as this one did. Great recipe JAMON0126!! We loved it! \n\n \n03\nof 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nIlhan Sharp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/22/2024\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nA keeper!\nThis recipe is so delicious!!

It was very easy to make and tasted good. It will go on my meal rotation list periodically for a change of pace taste.
