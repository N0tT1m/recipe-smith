I doubled the recipe and followed exactly as written in the recipe, then I added a heaping teaspoon of Vanilla Paste to the banana mixture before folding into flour mixture and it made a WORLD of difference. But I’m a retired pastry chef and my personal preference is that 99% of baked goods require vanilla. You just cannot make something as delicious as a banana muffin without it. I also stopped using extract and started using homemade vanilla paste a few years ago, this also leveled up everything I bake. I went ahead and folded in some Dark Chocolate Chunks \u0026 Chopped Walnuts for some texture, this also leveled up these muffins! This recipe doubled made 14 jumbo muffins. If I had not added in the Chocolate and Nuts it probably would have made exactly 12. The temperature and bake time was spot on. 350 for 25 minutes for the win. \n\n \n04\nof 1,162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nAllrecipes Member\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/13/2025\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\nI have been trying to find a way to sneak bananas into my daughters diet. No particular reason besides being healthy and balanced like the pediatrician's say. She \"hates\" banana bread. My other loves banana's, but cant eat them fast enough. So I decided to give this recipe a shot. I followed this recipe to a T, until the very end. Once everything in the recipe was ready to be placed in the muffin tin, I folded in a handful of chocolate chips (irresistible to kids) and a sprinkle of light brown sugar on top for a smell disguise. It works!! Kids ate them up without thinking twice! Not sure if it's healthy with my additions, but it's the thought that counts ;-) \n\n \n05\nof 1,162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nZippyYam7846\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/19/2024\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nA keeper!\nThis recipe is very easy to make. I sifted all dry ingredients, and added 1 tbsp of vanilla extract, and substituted unsweetened applesauce for some of the sugar (instead of 3/4 cup white sugar, I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of applesauce) and the muffins turned out extremely moist.When making this recipe, be precise in the measurements of ingredients, and do not over mix the ingredients.I have made this recipe twice in one week, they were that good. :-) Highly recommend. \n\n \n06\nof 1,162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \ntrisha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/25/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nCrowd-pleaser\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\nSo easy to make.
