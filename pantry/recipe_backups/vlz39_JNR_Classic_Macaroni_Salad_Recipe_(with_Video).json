Grated carrots and pimento peppers are optional, but they add welcome flavor and color. \n\n\n  How Do You Make Macaroni Salad?   \n Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade macaroni salad: \n\n\n Cook the macaroni in salted water. Mix the mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, mustard, and seasonings together. Stir in the macaroni and remaining ingredients. Chill in the refrigerator.\n\n\n  Can You Make Macaroni Salad Ahead of Time?   \n Yes, macaroni salad makes a great make-ahead potluck dish. In fact, since the flavors need time to meld in the refrigerator, it might actually be better to make it a day or two in advance. \n\n\n  How Long Does Macaroni Salad Last?   \n This homemade macaroni salad can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days. We don’t recommend freezing this recipe, as the noodles will likely become mushy after they are thawed. \n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n “This recipe is fantastic, I tasted it when I finished mixing,” says Sue Newman. “WOW, can't wait for it to get cold. I did make a couple of changesL I used celery salt instead of just salt and left the green pepper and pimento out.”\n\n\n “Great flavor,” raves one Allrecipes community member. “I used cellentani pasta and only ⅓ cup sugar. Also used some garlic powder and did not use bell pepper or pimento. Perfect accompaniment to our BBQ.”\n\n\n “This is a fantastic pasta salad,” according to Rebecca Timbers. “The only drawback is I have found is that now I am required to bring a big bowl to every family gathering no matter the season or holiday!”\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

Everyone raves about it 😊 only thing I do differently is add lots of eggs 🥚 we love eggy macaroni salad ♥️ \n\n \n07\nof 162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nsoapscrubs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/31/2023\nI thought it might be too oniony or mustardy for the fam, but nope, all good! The celery provides that necessary crunch, the carrots and peppers are pleasing, and there's just a hint of creaminess from the dressing, not too overpowering. \n\n \n08\nof 162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nToni _\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/23/2022\nLet it marinate together over night.STIR STIR STIR! It will come out perfectI've made this quite a few times at this point. First few rounds I stuck to the recipe exactly how it calls for. I really wouldn't do anything different except adding more carrots for the crunch. I used carrot chips. I added 3 heavy table spoons of roasted red peppers and it doesn't look noticeable so I may or may not add more in the future. Stick to the recipe exactly as it calls. I have gotten so many compliments and requests for it.STIR STIR STIR.. Stir it around after making and before serving. The macaroni absorbs the liquids so stir it. It will be perfection. \n\n \n09\nof 162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMEANDGOD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/04/2022\nEasy and delicious \n\n \n10\nof 162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nOrangeRoast1207\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/08/2022\nThis is one of the best recipes I found so far but made a few changes - I used less sugar and little less vinegar, I also replaced the green bell pepper with red bell pepper. I added a little more mayo and about a 1/4 cup of sour cream. Instructions say to chill for at least 4 hours and actually taste even better chilled longer (the next day)! \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll Also
