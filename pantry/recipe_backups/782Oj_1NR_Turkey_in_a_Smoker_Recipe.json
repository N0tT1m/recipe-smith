Learn how to smoke a turkey, and get our best seasoning and storage tips, right here.\n\n\n  How to Smoke a Turkey  \n It's easier than you think to make a perfectly smoked turkey. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:\n\n\n Rub Turkey: Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Rub the entire turkey with crushed garlic, then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the turkey in an aluminum roasting pan.Stuff the Turkey: (Note: The turkey should already be clean, with the neck and giblets removed). Stuff the hollowed cavity with butter, cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cover the seasoned and stuffed turkey loosely with foil.Smoke the Turkey: Add wood chips to the smoker according to the manufacturer's directions and place the covered turkey in the pre-heated smoker. Smoke the turkey, basting regularly, until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink at the bone.\n\n\n  How Long to Smoke a Turkey  \n How long to smoke a turkey depends on multiple factors, including the size of the turkey and the type of smoker. When you cook it according to this recipe, a 10-pound turkey should be done in about 5 hours.\n\n\n You'll know the turkey is done when an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads at least 180 degrees F.\n\n\n  At What Temperature Should You Smoke Turkey?  \n For this recipe, you'll preheat your smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F. Low and slow smoking ensures a juicy texture and perfect flavor.\n\n\n  Can You Smoke a Frozen Turkey?  \n We don't recommend smoking a frozen turkey, as a frozen bird may not cook evenly (which may cause foodborne illness). Make sure your turkey is completely thawed before smoking.\n\n\n Learn more: How to Safely Thaw a Frozen Turkey\n\n\n  Seasoning for Smoked Turkey  \n The outside of this smoked turkey is simply seasoned with garlic and salt. The cavity is stuffed with a variety of ingredients (cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper) to infuse the bird with irresistible flavor from the inside out.\n\n\n  Should You Brine a Turkey for Smoking?  \n When it comes to smoking a turkey, brining is completely optional. The low and slow cooking actually draws the moisture into the turkey instead of out, so you don't need to add anything to keep it juicy. This top-rated recipe doesn't require a brine.\n\n\n  What to Serve With Smoked Turkey  \n Of course, the smoked turkey will be the star of your holiday table. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't leave room for sides!

Reheat until warmed through in the microwave, in the oven, or on the stove.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Tips and Praise  \n \"I absolutely love this recipe, it is always my family's favorite way of eating our Thanksgiving turkey,\" says Sabrina Leigh Millward. \"It always turns out so juicy with so much flavor!! I love to save the bones and make the best bone broth.\"\n\n\n \"This was delicious, better than deep-fried,\" according to MichaelORO. \"The skin is perfect, the meat is moist, and the flavor is consistent throughout.\"\n\n\n \"This was an excellent recipe for smoked turkey,\" raves Tammy. \"The flavors blended together nicely. We smoked it with an apple juice/water mixture. We used a Granny Smith apple in the cavity with the other ingredients. Very little leftovers.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

It got rave reviews from everyone (except the vegetarian in the family, of course). I was skeptical after reading the ingredients list. Cola in/on a turkey? I've used cola in recipes for various cuts of pork (smoked baby back ribs, pork butt, etc.), but never on poultry. However, I was way behind on planning, and grocery shopping, and time. So, since I had (nearly) all the ingredients on hand, I decided to give this recipe a try...and pray for halfway decent results. The result was so much better than I could have ever hoped for. It was so very moist and full of flavor!I am guilty of making a couple of tweaks to the original recipe, but only out of necessity. We have a pellet smoker, so used that with hickory pellets. And, somehow, I was out of seasoned salt...so, we sprinkled Cavender's on the outside instead after rubbing in the crushed garlic. The results were amazing!I didn't get a picture of the finished turkey because I was too busy with the rest of the meal...but here's one \"in progress\" on the pellet smoker. \n\n \n03\nof 67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nRichard Lowe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/29/2024\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\nFirst attempt with this recipe, came out moist and flavorful also did an overnight Brine 👍🏽 \n\n \n04\nof 67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nFluffyZiti6059\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/04/2023\nEasy and simple recipe11hrs later .. time to restWell see if the taste matches the looks \n\n \n05\nof 67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nHugo Montealegre\n12/24/2021\n \n\n \n06\nof 67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \ncrystaljones201515\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/26/2021\nMy husband decided this for Thanksgiving we would smoke our turkey was at 19lbs. He allowed for 20 hours of cooking time. We basically doubled the ingredients. We used a apple wood pellet and set smoker to 200 degree. After husband spent all night and every 2 hours basing it. At 16 hours our turkey was golden and holding internal temp of 184. I will say the meat was so tender it fell of the bone, the breast of the turkey was juicy and tender. This is amazing my whole family loved it.
