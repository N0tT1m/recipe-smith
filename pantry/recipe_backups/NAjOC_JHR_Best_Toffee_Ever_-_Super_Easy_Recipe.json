Look no further than toffee! This top-rated toffee recipe is beloved by the Allrecipes community because it's easy, quick, and absolutely irresistible.\n\n\n  What Is Toffee?  \n Toffee is a candy made by caramelizing sugar with butter. The mixture is heated until it reaches the hard crack stage (at least 300 degrees F), hardened, then broken into pieces.\n\n\n  Toffee vs. Caramel  \n Toffee and caramel have some similarities, but they have a few key differences. Caramel often contains milk or cream, which gives it a thicker and creamier consistency. The candies are also heated to different temperatures during the cooking process.\n\n\n  What Is Toffee Made Of?  \n Make this easy toffee with just five ingredients:\n\n\n Butter: This sweet and crunchy toffee starts with four sticks of melted butter.Sugar: Two cups of sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness.Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors.Chocolate chips: Melted semisweet chocolate chips are spread over the toffee for an extra layer of deliciousness.Almonds: Almonds lend welcome crunch. You can substitute walnuts or pecans, if desired.\n\n\n  How to Make Toffee  \n You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this toffee candy:\n\n\n Melt butter in a saucepan with sugar and salt.Bring the mixture to a boil. Cook until it's dark amber and 285 degrees F.Pour the toffee onto a prepared baking sheet.Sprinkle the chocolate chips onto the toffee, let soften, and spread in an even layer.Sprinkle the nuts over the chocolate.Let harden in the refrigerator. When the toffee is hard, break into pieces.\n\n\n  How to Store Toffee  \n Store homemade toffee in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week or in the fridge for up to two weeks.\n\n\n  Can You Freeze Toffee?  \n Yes! You can freeze toffee for up to three months. Arrange the hardened toffee pieces in a single layer on a baking sheet, cover, then freeze for at least a few hours or up to overnight. When the toffee is frozen, transfer the pieces to zip-top storage bags (make sure to squeeze out the excess air) or another freezer-safe container. Wrap in foil for extra protection. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"Super simple to make,\" according to jstbeyondreach. \"Took almost no time to put together, and was a huge crowd-pleaser. I used half light butter and half regular butter. Worked great and was super creamy.\"\n\n\n \"This is my go-to recipe for toffee,\" says Karen Griffiths. \"I must have had 20 failures over the years, but since I have been using this recipe I have had a good batch each time. I think the trick is cooking it on medium. DON'T RUSH IT!\"\n\n\n \"This really was very easy to make,\" raves Em. \"It was my first attempt at toffee and I was a little nervous, but it turned out great. As tempting as it is to keep stirring it, it really does make a big difference to just let it simmer.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

What?? Where has this recipe been my whole life?? Super easy. I stirred (one direction) while melting the butter and making sure it was combined with the sugar. I then left it on medium (not on the power boil burner) and did not stir again. I checked the temp with my battery operated thermometer and the crunch in a bowl of ice water. It went from 290 to 300 rather quickly, so I snatched it off in a panic and poured it into the pan over the chocolate and parchment paper. (I had melted some of the chocolate chips on the parchment paper in the oven and spread it over the area the toffee would go, then stuck it in the fridge until set. I poured the hot toffee over that set chocolate.) I then proceeded to add more chocolate over the top as instructed in the recipe. I left it in the fridge until the chocolate on top was set, then left out on the table overnight so the chocolate would not be cold and brittle when I broke it up. It is perfect. I actually made it to use in a copycat Levain coffee toffee cookie recipe, but have definitely been sneaking bites. :) Also, I left off the almonds for the sake of the cookie, but when I make it again for general consumption, I will have to put them on. :D \n\n \n03\nof 187\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nCaringDove2319\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/14/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\nWho knew that when Megan Orsini commented 18 years ago, she’d help so many! I followed her instructions and mine came out great. I only did a half batch though and I added a shot of espresso to my butter and sugar mix as it was melting! Came out SO yummy!

This one comes pretty darn close! I live in a humid area and cooked it to between 290 and 300 degrees and used a 10X15 inch pan, otherwise I followed the recipe carefully. It only took about 15 minutes to get the mixture up to temperature after the butter was melted. I used sliced almonds, chopped most of them and left some unchopped as suggested by another reviewer. This toffee is delicious! I'll be making it again. \n\n \n05\nof 187\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSandra Terry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/08/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nCrowd-pleaser\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\nEasy and very good!
