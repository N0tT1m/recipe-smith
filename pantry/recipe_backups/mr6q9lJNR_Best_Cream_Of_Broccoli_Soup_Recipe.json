It's thick, flavorful, creamy, and easy to throw together on whim with simple ingredients.\n\n\n  Best Cream Of Broccoli Soup Ingredients  \n Here's what you'll need to make the best cream of broccoli soup ever:\n\n\n Butter\nYou'll use butter twice in this recipe. Once to sauté the onions and celery (butter adds rich flavor to sautéed vegetables) and again at the end to make a roux.\n\n\n Onions and CeleryLike so many great soups, this recipe starts with onions and celery. These veggies add complexity and depth of flavor.\n\n\n BrothChicken broth is the liquid base for this cream of broccoli soup. For a vegetarian option, substitute vegetable broth.\n\n\n BroccoliYou can't have cream of broccoli soup without broccoli! Choose dark green broccoli with firm stems.\n\n\n Flour, Milk, and ButterAll-purpose flour, milk, and the rest of the butter are cooked together to create a roux. When added to the soup, it creates a thick and velvety texture that's impossible to resist.\n\n\n PepperGround black pepper is the perfect finishing touch. Add other spices and seasonings to taste.\n\n\n  How to Make Cream of Broccoli Soup  \n You can make this cream of broccoli soup recipe in about a half an hour, so it's the perfect choice for busy weeknights. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:\n\n\n  Cook the Vegetables  \n Sauté the onions and celery in butter until they're tender. Add the broccoli florets and the chicken broth, cover the pot, and simmer for about 10 minutes.\n\n\n  Blend the Ingredients  \n Use a countertop blender or an immersion blender to purée the soup. Give it a few quick pulses, then blend continuously until the soup is totally smooth.\n\n\n  Thicken the Soup  \n Melt a few tablespoons of butter in a separate saucepan. Stir in the flour, then the milk. Cook the milk mixture until it's thick and bubbly, then add it to the soup. Finish it off with a dash of pepper (and the other seasonings of your choosing).\n\n\n  How to Store Cream of Broccoli Soup  \n You'll need to refrigerate this soup within two hours of cooking. Let it cool to room temperature, then transfer it to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for three to four days.\n\n\n  Can You Freeze Cream of Broccoli Soup?  \n Yes! You can absolutely freeze cream of broccoli soup — and you should if you plan to keep it for more than a few days.\n\n\n Ladle the soup in serving-sized portions into zip-top freezer bags. Label the bags with the date, lay them flat in the freezer, and freeze for up to two to three months.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"Delicious and buttery,\" raves LoriT. \"I used skim milk and it was great. Like some of the other reviews, I scooped out about a ladle of the cooked broccoli and did not puree it. Adding it back to the pureed mixture gave the soup a more hearty texture.\"\n\n\n \"A very easy recipe,\" says CP. \"Instead of using broccoli florets, I chopped up the broccoli stalks and sauteed them along with the celery and onion, then simmered in the broth until tender enough to puree with the immersion blender. I steamed a few florets and used them as garnish along with toasted croutons.\"\n\n\n \"I make this soup a couple times a month, with the intention of freezing it for later use,\" says Julia Courtney. \"The problem is ... we always eat it all! I drizzle mine with olive oil and sprinkle with fresh grated Parmesan cheese! SO good!\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

Made with cream rather than milk. Hand immersion blender works, and is easier than transferring to a blender; but it splatters, so be careful. \n\n \n04\nof 174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nRafa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/25/2024\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nA keeper!\nWould add some salt while cooking \n\n \n05\nof 174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nFunkyChive1559\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/17/2024\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\nI added raw spinach to the blender, mushroom and chicken at the end and topped with walnuts, loved it! \n\n \n06\nof 174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \ncookiemonster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/29/2024\nHm this is ok. Because mine had plenty of liquid, I used 1/4th cup cream instead of putting in 2 cups of milk. I added a dash of hot sauce. \n\n \n07\nof 174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nZippyPop1611\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/18/2024\nAll I can say is...

But instead of using the florets, I chopped up the stalks and sauteed them along with the celery and onion, then simmered in the broth until tender enough to puree with the immersion blender. I also substituted half and half for half of the milk, only because I needed to get rid of it. I did steam a few florets and used them as garnish along with toasted croutons. Using the stalks does three things - 1) It uses them instead of throwing them away...just trim the ends and cut small enough to cook quickly. 2) it keeps the soup from being full of green \"seeds\" from the florets, that then get stuck in your teeth. 3) it lets you use the broccoli another day for a chicken, rice, and broccoli casserole! \n\n \n09\nof 174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nArtsyRoll7448\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/30/2023\nAbsolutely delicious 😋 \n\n \n10\nof 174\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nVioletFlax4220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/13/2023\nI did a 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream as some one else recommended below.
