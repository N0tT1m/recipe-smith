Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.\n\n\n\nOriginal recipe (1X) yields 4 servings\n \n\n2 tablespoons sesame oil\n\n\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n\n\n1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined\n\n\n1 cup frozen peas and carrots\n\n\n½ cup frozen corn\n\n\n2 cloves garlic, finely minced, or more to taste\n\n\n3 large eggs, lightly beaten\n\n\n4 cups cooked rice\n\n\n3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions\n\n\n3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, or more to taste\n\n\n½ teaspoon salt, or to taste\n\n\n½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste\n\n\n\nDirections\n\n\n Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through.\n\n\n\n\n Remove shrimp from the skillet using a slotted spoon, allowing oils and cooking juices to remain in the skillet. Place shrimp on a plate and set aside.\n\n\n\n\n Add peas and carrots and corn to the skillet and cook, stirring intermittently, until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Push vegetables to the side of the skillet, pour eggs into the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n Stir shrimp, rice, and green onions into the skillet. Drizzle evenly with soy sauce, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook until shrimp is reheated through, about 2 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n I Made It\n\n\n\n\n \nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition Facts (per serving)\n\n\n\n552\nCalories\n\n\n19g \nFat\n\n\n64g \nCarbs\n\n\n30g \nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\n \nShow Full Nutrition Label\nHide Full Nutrition Label\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition Facts\n\n\n\nServings Per Recipe\n4\n\n\n\n\nCalories\n552\n\n\n\n\n\n% Daily Value *\n\n\n\nTotal Fat\n19g\n\n\n24%\n\n\n\n\nSaturated Fat\n4g\n\n\n18%\n\n\n\n\nCholesterol\n312mg\n\n\n104%\n\n\n\n\nSodium\n971mg\n\n\n42%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Carbohydrate\n64g\n\n\n23%\n\n\n\n\nDietary Fiber\n3g\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\nTotal Sugars\n2g\n\n\n\n\nProtein\n30g\n\n\n61%\n\n\n\n\nVitamin C\n9mg\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n80mg\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\nIron\n7mg\n\n\n39%\n\n\n\n\nPotassium\n425mg\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

Add a half can or 8 oz of pineapple tidbits. This simple fried rice recipe is easy to build upon. I make this when I need to use up leftover rice, veggies, or chicken breast from the fridge. Separating each set of ingredients as you cook is best. I add Tajin citrus pepper after cooking rather than black pepper during. I sometimes add sautéed chopped cabbage with a white onion. In lieu of sesame oil, I’ll dump a teaspoon of sesame seeds in with the shrimp. I often pour a few ounces of hot water on top of the rice as I mix to prevent sticking.Pictured with hoisin sauce and Yum Yum sauce. \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll Also
