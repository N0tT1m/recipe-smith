Well, this recipe is a winner.”\n\n\n “Had this on a brioche bun with mustard, ketchup, pickles and lettuce and it was great,” says Kevin Faulkner. “Going to try this as a meatball substitute for a bulgogi dish.”\n\n\n “This was the first time I’ve ever made veggie burgers and it was so good,” according to one Allrecipes community member. “The trick was to chop up the veggies and then squeeze out all the excess water from the pepper and onion in a paper towel before putting it into the mixture.”\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

We decided we would add jalapeno or other spices to make it a bit more exciting. I also took the advice of others and squeezed the liquid out of the minced green pepper and onion, had no problem forming patties. I saved this recipe ages ago and never got around to making it...I wish I had! It's easy and delicious, much cheaper than store bought. Now that I've made it I will definitely be making it more often, thanks for the recipe! \n\n \n03\nof 363\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nDanielle Stadelman RDN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/14/2023\nI have never made a veggie burger before but it was so simple and easy to whip up!

I decided NOT to make any changes. Well, that’s not entirely true. I rinsed the can of black beans and baked them in a 325° oven on a cooking sheet for 10 minutes before mashing, (I had seen this tip on another site) They didn’t fall apart like other bean burgers I’ve made. We added guacamole, relish, roasted tomatoes and served on half an English muffin. \n\n \n05\nof 363\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMarylu Fernandez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/22/2023\nEasy to make, economical, HEALTHY \u0026 DELICIOUS.

I made a few alterations, however. I used 2tsp of chili powder and 2 tsp of cumin. I used 2 tsp of a standard chili sauce as that is what I had on hand and 2 eggs were needed. I followed the instructions to mix but once all ingredients together I once more put all in the food processor for a few seconds. As others did in the reviews I made my 4 patties on parchment paper and put in the freezer for 1/2 hour before grilling. They tasted great and presented well. Made twice and this last time had black beans in the refrigerator that I had cooked a previous day that I used. Using my cooked beans they were easier to patty but tasted the same as when I used the canned. Thanks for sharing this healthy burger recipe. \n\n \n07\nof 363\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLaila\n06/29/2021\n \n\n \n08\nof 363\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJeanne Bartow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/28/2021\nI love this recipe.
