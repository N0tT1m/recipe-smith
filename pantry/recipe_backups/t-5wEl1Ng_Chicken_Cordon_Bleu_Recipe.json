Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked.\n\n\n Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients: chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices. It's usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard.\n\n\n  What Does 'Cordon Bleu' Mean?  \n \"Cordon bleu\" translates to \"blue ribbon.\" According to Larousse Gastronomique, a French food encyclopedia, the phrase dates back to medieval times when the most prestigious order a knight could earn was called the Cross of the Holy Spirit. The honor was signified by a medal that hung from a blue ribbon known as Le Cordon Bleu. Over time, the blue ribbon became a symbol of excellence. The term, meanwhile, became associated with food that meets the highest of standards or that is prepared by the most prestigious chefs.\n\n\n  How to Make Chicken Cordon Bleu  \n There are many ways to make chicken cordon bleu, from the traditional French method to the simple oven-baked one detailed here. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:\n\n\n  Prep the Chicken  \n Cover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet to create thin, even pieces. Thoroughly season the chicken with salt and pepper.\n\n\n  Assemble and Roll  \n Top each piece of chicken with one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of ham. Roll the chicken vertically so that the ham and cheese are contained. Secure each roll with a toothpick.\n\n\n  Bread and Bake  \n Arrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink, top each roll with half a slice of Swiss, and continue baking until the cheese is melted.\n\n\nHow To Make Breadcrumbs\n\n\n  How Long to Cook Chicken Cordon Bleu  \n This recipe should be fully cooked after 30-35 minutes in an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. However, every oven is different — the chicken should no longer be pink and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).\n\n\n  What to Serve With Chicken Cordon Bleu  \n Chicken cordon bleu is traditionally topped with a decadent cream sauce made with Parmesan cheese and Dijon mustard — you can improvise your own recipe or try spiking our top-rated Alfredo Sauce with a hint of Dijon.\n\n\n Looking for some side dish inspiration? We've got you covered. Try one of these delicious ideas:\n\n\n Mascarpone Mashed PotatoesEasy Garden Green BeansGourmet Mushroom RisottoSteamed BroccoliPommes Anna with GruyereClassic Restaurant Caesar Salad\n\n\n  How to Store Chicken Cordon Bleu  \n Store your chicken cordon bleu leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for three to four days. Reheat in the oven instead of the microwave to avoid sogginess. About 10 minutes at 350 degrees F should do the trick.\n\n\n  How to Freeze Chicken Cordon Bleu  \n To freeze chicken cordon bleu, simply arrange the completely-cooled rolls on a lined baking sheet, cover, and freeze for about two hours. Transfer the now-frozen rolls to an airtight freezer bag labeled with the date. Freeze for up to four months.\n\n\n To thaw frozen chicken cordon bleu, transfer the container to the fridge the night before you plan to serve it. Bake the thawed rolls for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees F.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Tips and Community Praise  \n \"What a wonderful recipe,\" raves Pj kearns. \"Simple and delicious! I did use a little olive oil to roll the chicken in after it was constructed and then lightly breaded them. Works out perfectly!\"\n\n\n \"This recipe was the first I have cooked for my family, and they just would not stop complimenting me on it,\" says one Allrecipes community member. \"Not yet being an experienced cook, I didn't add any gimmicks or tricks of my own, and I found that I didn't need to. A great, easy recipe!\"\n\n\n \"Love this recipe,\" says LILYFIRE41. \"My husband declared that this was one of his favorite things I've ever made, and he stressed what a big deal that was! Great recipe to use up leftover ham. I made it with the sauce that other members recommended (cream of chicken, lemon juice \u0026 sour cream).\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions be Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

Check yes to both!!! No - it’s not the most exquisite version out there but dang! Is it good! If you have a good, sharp knife - you could use three chicken breasts and slice them in half to make 6 portions (which is what I did). I still pounded them flat because chicken breasts are imperfect in thickness. Having them in equal thickness will insure cook time accuracy. I also eyeballed and added garlic and onion powder to the breadcrumb mixture - approx 1/4 tsp each. Took another reviewer’s advice and cooked at 400 for 25 min, then added the cheese to the top for the last 3 minutes (28 min total) for perfectly baked chicken. Served with White Sauce by Carolyn O from this site - which was very nice but not a requirement to the success of this recipe. Overall very good take on a classic favorite!
