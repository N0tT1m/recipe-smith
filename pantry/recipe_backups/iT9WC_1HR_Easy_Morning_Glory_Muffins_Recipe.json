I think this recipe is a brilliant mix of healthy and delicious! I made a few changes to the original recipe: I used 1 cup of honey instead of 1 1/2 cups of sugar, which made them nicely sweet without being overpowering. I also swapped the freshly grated carrots for 2 cups of green vegetable pulp, which added a healthy twist. To spice things up, I added 1/4 teaspoon of ginger powder and 1/4 teaspoon of grated nutmeg.The mixed nuts—pecans, walnuts, almonds, and Brazilian nuts—added a delicious crunch. Overall, these muffins were easy to make and turned out amazing! I’ll definitely be making them again. \n\n \n04\nof 137\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nCheekySage6886\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/06/2024\nOriginal recipe is great. I want something a little healthier, so here is what I did. Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup (brown), eliminated the oil and replaced it with 1 1/4 cups of unsweetened apple sauce, used 4 eggs and 3 scoops of vanilla protein powder. Used 1 whole shredded Asian carrot (large one) and 1 and 3/4 shredded apples. Made 12 delicious extra large muffins. Oh and used pecans instead of walnuts and craisins instead of raisins. Came out perfect. Working on eliminating the sugar altogether \n\n \n05\nof 137\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nElfinWok4986\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/26/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\nI absolutely loved it and the flavor was incredible however, 1 cup of oil is too much for this recipe. It was so much that when I took the muffins out of the pan, there was pools of oil still left in the pan. Still so delicious tho. I read a comment that you could replace that cup of oil with a cup of applesauce and I’ll definitely be trying that next time. Or maybe even 1/2 cup oil and half cup almond milk. This recipe made me 16 beautifully large muffins. So good! \n\n \n06\nof 137\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTetya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/18/2023\nThey are great for my taste. My husband wasn't impressed. I didn't have nuts and made some changes. I used cranberries instead of raisins, coconut oil instead of vegetable. Added shredded honeynut squash. Baked 12 muffins and 6 mini pound cakes for about 25 min. \n\n \n07\nof 137\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nTidyHash4878\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/01/2023\nInstead of walnuts I used a handful of chopped pecans and instead of apple I used 1.5 tablespoons of applesauce. It was phenomenal.. and for the topping I made 1 cup of confectioners sugar with 2 tablespoons of real lemon juice from lemons. Great recipe. \n\n \n08\nof 137\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLynette\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/10/2023\nWas perfect as is \n\n \n09\nof 137\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMatureHoney1090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/19/2023\nThese muffins were excellent! I make them often. I think next time I will cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and try 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. \n\n \n10\nof 137\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nPenny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/08/2022\nExcellent recipe. Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of applesauce, cut walnut to half and topped up with unsalted sunflower seeds. Perfect breakfast muffins. Just my preferences, but awesome recipe to take off from!
