Garlic, cream, and fresh thyme join meaty caramelized mushrooms and diced onions for a rich, fragrant bowlful of homemade goodness.\n\n\n This comforting soup recipe makes an enticing appetizer course or stand-alone dish — experience the velvety swirls of flavor for yourself (and never buy the store-bought stuff again).\n\n\n  How to Make Creamy Mushroom Soup  \n Luscious, herb-infused mushroom soup is just a few steps away. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe:\n\n\n Caramelize the mushrooms in butter. Add the onions, thyme, garlic, and broth, then bring to a simmer. Puree the soup, add cream, and season. \n\n\n Chef's Notes\nPrep time assumes you are using pre-sliced mushrooms. If not, your prep time will be longer.You can also use an immersion stick blender to purée the soup.\n\n\n\n  What to Eat With Creamy Mushroom Soup  \n A hearty bowl of mushroom soup is a meal in itself, but this dish pairs well with many other foods. Crispy baked chicken or a peppery skirt steak would both make good partners for this top-rated recipe.\n\n\n Or, serve cream of mushroom soup with crisp, tangy salad to cut through the richness. Any way you serve it, Chef John's savory offering will keep you coming back for more.\n\n\n  How to Store Mushroom Soup  \n Mushroom soup can be safely stored in the refrigerator for up to one week. Wait for the soup to fully cool before. Reheat gently on the stovetop or in a microwave.\n\n\n  Can You Freeze Mushroom Soup?  \n Looking to save some soup for later? You can freeze the leftovers for up to two months if stored properly. Place single servings of room temperature soup in freezer bags, squeeze out any air, seal, and lay flat for best results.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"The flavor is absolutely delicious,\" says reviewer gellerd. \"If you love mushrooms and want to feel like a professional chef, make this soup. Outstanding recipe, Chef John!\"\n\n\n \"This recipe takes time but is worth the effort,\" shares home cook Lindsey. \"I used a mixture of crimini and shiitake mushrooms. I can't eat cream so I added lactose-free milk with a bit of corn starch.\"\n\n\n \"Fantastic mushroom soup!\" raves Shelley W. \"I made it exactly as written and was amazed at how deep and wonderful the flavors were. I am a cream of mushroom soup lover and this was the best I have ever had.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Rai Mincey\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

I used an immersion blender instead of a blender as I prefer to have some bits of mushrooms and not all purified.

However, if you have a couple hours to dedicate to this? You will not be disappointed! It’s FANTASTIC!! The only change is I didn’t have fresh thyme. So, shortly after adding the flour, but before adding the liquids in Step 5, I added 1/2 tsp dried thyme plus 1/4 tsp ground thyme. Mixed that in well before adding the broth. I only have an immersion blender so it wasn’t creamy smooth as I believe Chef John intended but! I thought a perfect blend of creamy with mushroom pieces! Bowls licked clean - it was that good!

It’s worth the steps and time it takes to make this luscious soup.Also, I agree with other reviews that a blender or food processor is a must and not an immersion blender.Next time I will, at my husband’s suggestion, reserve more mushroom slices for texture.In the words of Chef John “as always enjoy” and we did!! \n\n \n07\nof 67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nFaye Hinkley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/19/2023\nI actually enjoyed this without the puree step; I guess I like to chew my soup! \n\n \n08\nof 67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJonathan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/14/2022\nFabulous result!
