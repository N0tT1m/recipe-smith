It makes the best tomato soup.Chicken broth: Using broth will help make this more of a soup and less like a sauce.Garlic: The recipe calls for about four cloves, but feel free to use however much your heart desires. Onion: A yellow or white onion would be ideal for this soup.Butter: Use butter to make a roux, a thickening agent made from flour and fat.Flour: Use all-purpose flour to make your roux.Sugar and Salt: Add these two seasonings until the soup suites your tastebuds.\n\n\n  How to Make Tomato Soup  \n\nBoil the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and broth.\nRun the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl.\nMake a roux.\nAdd the tomato mixture and season.\n\n\n  What to Serve With Tomato Soup  \n Of course, tomato soup's best friend is a Grilled Cheese Sandwich. But if you want to mix it up, try one of these delicious recipes:\n\n\n\nBLT\nAvocado Shrimp Ceviche-Estillo Sarita\nChicken Pesto Paninis\nLazy Chicken Parmesan Grilled Cheese\n\n\n  How to Store Tomato Soup  \n Store (completely cooled) tomato soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days.\n\n\n  How to Freeze Tomato Soup  \n This recipe makes six servings, so if you need to freeze leftovers, that's okay!

I did add fresh garlic at the beginning and fresh basil at the end. Served with open faced baguettes topped with cheese. This recipe is easily multiplied and canned if you have a bunch of tomatoes ready for processing,\" says girlslovetoeat.\n\n\n \"I had several roma tomatoes that were getting soft in the fridge, so this was the perfect recipe to use them up. It was sooo tasty, and I liked that the recipe does not have heavy cream. I added basil and black pepper to the tomato mixture instead of cloves,\" according to hokiebetty.\n\n\n \"Delicious soup!

They are generally richer and have the best texture to create soup.\n\n\nLearn More:\nWhat are Heirloom Tomatoes?\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow should you fix bland tomato soup?\n\n\n \nAdd fresh basil. This is a guaranteed way to make your soup fresh and flavorful.Brown tomato paste with some butter and add it to your soup. When making your roux, this is a great opportunity to add in half a can or more of tomato paste with your butter and flour.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you thicken tomato soup?\n\n\n \nIf you have a parmesan rind in your fridge, consider adding that to your soup as it simmers. While tomato paste can fix bland soup, it can also thicken it. If you add tomato paste to your roux or at any point while the soup simmers, it will help thicken the soup up.Consider making a slurry and adding it your soup. A slurry is one part cornstarch to two parts cold water. You don't need to use that much for a slurry to work either. A teaspoon or tablespoon of cornstarch will suffice.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between tomato soup and tomato bisque?\n\n\n \nTomato bisque is also a type of soup, but it often uses milk or heavy whipping cream. The texture of tomato bisque will be creamier and richer, as a result.

This was PERFECT! I prepared it, mostly, as instructed (I used 4 whole cloves instead of 4 cloves of garlic as others have mentioned), I omitted the sugar as the tomatoes were sweet enough. I used a very juicy type of tomato, so after peeling and cutting them up, I left them in a colander to drain most of the liquid out. I don't have a food mill so I used an immersion blender. There were still seeds in the soup, but that didn't matter to me. It was SUCH a fresh tasting recipe with simple ingredients. I will keep this one, for sure! \n\n \n05\nof 209\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nAmy Grosso Dunn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/29/2024\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\nMade no changes, and felt no sugar needed- with tomatoes from garden they are sweet enough!

Goes great with grilled cheese. However, I have always used 4 cloves. NOT 4 clovers of garlic. Don’t get me wrong, I have an unhealthy relationship with garlic ( and Starbucks) but it doesn’t belong in this one. Also, I use an immersion blender to smooth all of this out. Best tomato soup recipe on Allrecipes in my humble opinion. \n\n \n07\nof 209\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nArtsyMixer2676\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/30/2023\nSo easy!
