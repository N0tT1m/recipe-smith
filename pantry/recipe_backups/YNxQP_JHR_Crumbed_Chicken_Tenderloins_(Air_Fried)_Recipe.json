For 2 reasons. FIRST it was so quick and easy and absolutely delicious. We followed the directions exactly. The tenders we had weighed 1.16 lbs which ended up yielding 7 tenders. SECOND Mixing the oil with the breadcrumbs was ABSOLUTE GENIUS. No need for double dipping as the breadcrumbs stayed perfectly on the tenders. We will be using that method from now on. We made these again but this time we tweaked the spices to our southern taste buds. To the breadcrumbs we added 1t Cayenne Pepper 1/2t Garlic Powder with 1/2t Spanish Paprika and mixed all together then instead of vegetable oil we like to use Avocado oil. Our Air Frier is small so we could only get 3 tenders at a time. When we got to the last tender we turned the temperature down to 375° and cooked it for 10 minutes and then flipped for another 10 minutes. That seems to be the best temperature and time in our Air Fryer. No 2 Air Fryer’s are the same from what we are hearing. The next batch we make we will try 1 1/2t of Cayenne Pepper or try adding 1 1/2t of FRANKS to the egg. For dipping we had 2 sauces. One was Ranch and the other was FRANKS mixed with Plain Greek Yogurt. As you can see we served them with Grilled Corn and a Garden fresh salad with a few shakes of Organic Herbs De Provence, Either way LAUNA we can’t thank you enough for sharing your recipe with us. What a Great Low Carb recipe.Thanks again LOVES2COOK. \n\n \n03\nof 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nDaCook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/26/2023\nEasy and Tasty!

How you season it is up to you. I used Italian bread crumbs and added some cayenne pepper. Eight breasts, though? In my tiny air fryer, that would have taken me all night! I only did three breasts and for that, I had to double the recipe. Not sure how you would bread eight breasts with just one egg!LOL: edit here, it's supposed to be eight TENDERLOINS, not breasts! That's ok--we ate them all! \n\n \n06\nof 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nHeartyHam9841\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/01/2023\nI liked this recipe (of course I added my own spices after reading other reviews. I used1 1/2 cups Panko bread crumbs. Added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 tsp Ground Red Cayenne Pepper. I will have to say…DELICIOUS 😋I baked these lower in the oven on 400 for 25 mins turned them half way thru.

I used a Costco bag of tenderloins, so I doubled the recipe. My family likes it spicy, so to the doubled recipe, I added: 1 tsp of Poultry Seasoning, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp of Cayenne, 1/4 tsp salt, and a generous amount of fresh ground pepper. As others have said, don't crowd your basket, and 6 minutes, then flip is perfect. Absolutely tender, tasty, and yum! \n\n \n08\nof 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nkcarpenterhawaii\n01/03/2022\n \n\n \n09\nof 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nCasablancaise\n10/08/2021\n \n\n \n10\nof 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nScott Thomas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/04/2020\nThis was my first time making this recipe and it came out FANTASTIC!
