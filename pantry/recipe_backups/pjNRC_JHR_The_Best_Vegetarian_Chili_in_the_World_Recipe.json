Being asked to make it again for Christmas. Substituted one pack of grillers for the tubed impossible sausage.

Here's my changes : no celery, added one can drained pinto beans, used one package of Beyond Beef brand feisty veggie crumbles and only ONE (28 oz) can of crushed fire roasted tomatoes. Everything else exactly to the recipe. I was a little hesitant about the amount of chili powder but went ahead anyway and was prepared to add an extra can of tomatoes but DID NOT need to. Absolutely perfect recipe - like goldilocks says \"just right\". I do like chili to be thick not too much tomato to ingredient ratio. Put some shredded cheddar and dollop of sour cream to serve. Will make this again and highly recommend! \n\n \n07\nof 272\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nChillyYolk3784\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12/03/2022\nI won the office chili cook-off with this recipe!

I have omitted as well as utilized alternatives with vegetables and spices. Not particularly a fan of corn in chili so I diced up petite turnips instead, which makes it a bit robust I think. Being a huge fan of spices, decided to sauté the cumin and paprika with the onions as well as add more cumin as it slowly simmers. \n\n \n10\nof 272\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \ncjone1992\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/19/2022\nGreat chili starter!

Oh, my Impossible meat, 1 Regular \u0026 1 Spicy sausage was to die for! I used everything else that recipe called for except celery \u0026 corn just wasn't feeling it. Definitely a keeper!
