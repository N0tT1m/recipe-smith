Avoid ones that appear bruised or wrinkly. \nLemon: You’ll need a tablespoon + one teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. You’ll also need fresh lemon zest. \nSugars: Use white granulated sugar for the cake batter and dust the finished cake with confectioners’ sugar before serving. \nEggs: Two large eggs give the cake richness and flavor. Make sure your eggs are room temperature before incorporating them into the batter. \nSour cream: A cup of sour cream adds even more richness and moisture. Plus, it gives the cake a subtle tangy flavor. \nOil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, is essential for this moist and dense lemon blueberry cake.\nVanilla and salt: Vanilla extract and a pinch of salt enhance the overall flavor of the citrusy cake.\nFlour: All-purpose flour gives the cake structure. Tossing the berries in flour, meanwhile, will help prevent them from sinking. \nBaking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cake rise. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/mLxZyev62cLNeJiUynwijH7uUzU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/273697fresh-blueberry-lemon-cakeFranceC4x3-56eef44290e048659d56e990024c4230.jpg\"\nwidth=\"3384\"\nheight=\"2538\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/CQus2mFPK4WAyly7BAO97PCOUBI=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/273697fresh-blueberry-lemon-cakeFranceC4x3-56eef44290e048659d56e990024c4230.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"slice of blueberry lemon cake with blueberries on plate, dusted with powdered sugar\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n France C\n\n  How to Make Lemon Blueberry Cake  \n You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this homemade lemon blueberry cake: \n\n\n Toss the berries in flour and lemon juice. Make the batter. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan, then top with half of the blueberry mixture. Pour the remaining batter over the berries, then finish with the remaining berry mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean. Dust the cooled cake with confectioners’ sugar. \n\n\n  How to Store Lemon Blueberry Cake  \n Store the lemon blueberry cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days or in the refrigerator for up to one week. \n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n “Easy to make and delicious,” according to Grace Miner. “It was just the right sweetness and was a terrific way to use fresh picked berries.”\n\n\n “Very good,” says Allrecipes Allstar Yoly. “The only thing different that I did was to use frozen blueberries that I had previously flash frozen.

Butter and lightly flour the sides of a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.\n\n\n\n\n Place blueberries in a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon flour and 1 teaspoon lemon juice.\n\n\n\n\n Beat sugar and eggs in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer on high speed until thickened and light in color, at least 5 minutes.

Add lemon juice and lemon zest and mix well.\n\n\n\n\n Pour 1/2 the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Spread 1/2 the blueberry mixture over batter.

Remove outer ring from springform pan and let cool completely.

The final product was way too dense. It had no flavor either. I made no substitutions to this recipe; the only difference is I baked the batter as mini muffins. I question the ratio of 2 tsp. of baking powder to two cups of flour. \n\n \n03\nof 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMonkeysMomma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/13/2024\nI've been eyeing up this recipe for a while, so tonight I finally made it....and I have never made a cake from scratch like this before. First off, it was a very easy recipe to follow. And I followed it *almost* to a T, with the 2 exceptions being that I used frozen blueberries and I added almost all of the juice from the lemon I zested. (I had tasted the batter with the 1 tbsp of juice and felt like it needed more). And I didn't have a 9\" springform pan, so I substituted it with a regular 9\" cake pan and it worked fine. Overall, this cake came out quite pleasant! It was very moist from the sour cream and vegetable oil, and it was only subtly sweet, with most of the flavor coming from the blueberries. I would definitely make this again, but tweak it slightly so that it's a bit sweeter (personal preference). \n\n \n04\nof 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nYoly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/23/2023\nVery good.

I brought it to work and it disappeared quickly. I agree with the directions that it is difficult to tell when the middle is cooked due to the blueberries. Mine came out a little undercooked (even though it seemed done), so I would go the full 45 minutes next time. I didn’t think there would be enough lemon in the ingredients, but I followed the stated amounts anyway. You end up with a very light lemon flavor, which I thought was perfect, which doesn't overpower the blueberries. I would make this again! \n\n \n09\nof 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/10/2022\nDelicious. The consistency came out just like a giant blueberry muffin. I used more than the stated lemon zest and still couldn’t taste the lemon. Perhaps it was the lemon I used? Other than that, great recipe and would make it again. \n\n \n10\nof 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nChris Gershtein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/30/2021\nThis cake came out very well. It received rave reviews from all. I love lemon and don't like very sweet desserts so I used about double the lemon zest and 1/2 cup lemon juice in the batter. I also brushed the top with limoncello when it was cool and served it with whipped cream. Very tasty! \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll Also

  "ingredients": "Butter and flour: Prevent sticking by buttering and flouring the sides of a 9-inch springform pan.;Berries: Choose fresh blueberries that are fragrant and deeply colored. Avoid ones that appear bruised or wrinkly.;Lemon: You’ll need a tablespoon + one teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. You’ll also need fresh lemon zest.;Sugars: Use white granulated sugar for the cake batter and dust the finished cake with confectioners’ sugar before serving.;Eggs: Two large eggs give the cake richness and flavor. Make sure your eggs are room temperature before incorporating them into the batter.;Sour cream: A cup of sour cream adds even more richness and moisture. Plus, it gives the cake a subtle tangy flavor.;Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, is essential for this moist and dense lemon blueberry cake.;Vanilla and salt: Vanilla extract and a pinch of salt enhance the overall flavor of the citrusy cake.;Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cake structure. Tossing the berries in flour, meanwhile, will help prevent them from sinking.;Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cake rise.",
  "instructions": "Toss the berries in flour and lemon juice.;Make the batter.;Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan, then top with half of the blueberry mixture.;Pour the remaining batter over the berries, then finish with the remaining berry mixture.;Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.;Dust the cooled cake with confectioners’ sugar.;Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter and lightly flour the sides of a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.;Place blueberries in a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon flour and 1 teaspoon lemon juice.;Beat sugar and eggs in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer on high speed until thickened and light in color, at least 5 minutes. Mix in sour cream, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and salt on low speed until just combined. Add 2 cups flour and baking powder and mix until combined. Add lemon juice and lemon zest and mix well.;Pour 1/2 the batter into the prepared pan and spread evenly. Spread 1/2 the blueberry mixture over batter. Pour in remaining cake batter and spread remaining blueberries on top, pushing them halfway into the batter.;Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove outer ring from springform pan and let cool completely. Dust top of cooked cake with confectioners' sugar using a small sifter.",
