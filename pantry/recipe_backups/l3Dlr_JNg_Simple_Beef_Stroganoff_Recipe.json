This simple ground beef stroganoff comes together in 20 minutes with just six ingredients.\n\n\n  What Is Beef Stroganoff?  \n Beef stroganoff is an iconic Russian dish that consists of beef in a creamy sauce. According to legend, it was created by chefs who worked for the Stroganov family in the 1800s. The dish is often made with mushrooms and served over rice or egg noodles.\n\n\n  What Makes This Recipe So 'Simple?'  \n Traditional beef stroganoff is made with steak, a roux-based sauce, and sauteed mushrooms. But, as the title suggests, this recipe is simplified. It relies on shortcut ingredients, such as ground beef and canned cream of mushroom soup, to keep the cook time down and to cut down on extra steps.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/uAmzH5_vIwuIXMh28BDML6hntQY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/16311-simple-beef-stroganoff-step-5-178103-4x3-706da460ccc8443fbd561f5c5dfa02e4.jpg\"\nwidth=\"2000\"\nheight=\"1500\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/YAinK-zE3Vj_XY2SPr1Ht1KoeMU=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/16311-simple-beef-stroganoff-step-5-178103-4x3-706da460ccc8443fbd561f5c5dfa02e4.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"making beef stroganoff on the stove\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Dotdash Meredith Food Studios\n\n  How to Make Beef Stroganoff  \n You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what can you can expect when you make this ground beef stroganoff:\n\n\n Saute ground beef until brown, then drain the fat. Add the canned soup and garlic powder. Simmer for about 10 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir cooked egg noodles and sour cream into the meat mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\n  What to Serve With Beef Stroganoff  \n Since this ground beef stroganoff is a rather heavy dish, you may not need a side dish at all. A simple side salad, though, is a great way to round out your meal and to add a pop of color.\n\n\n Of course, if you want something a little different, you could leave out the egg noodles and serve the ground beef and sauce mixture over white rice or mashed potatoes.\n\n\n  How to Store Beef Stroganoff  \n Store leftover beef stroganoff in an airtight container in the fridge for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/1RCPsJYZMpo1fETbvW-YfM7uLDY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2283712_SimpleBeefStroganoff4x3-3deaf2954c754a2c900ca197a252a241.jpg\"\nwidth=\"960\"\nheight=\"720\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/WStZBZ6ICfv-zlGAGZihQNvmzoE=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2283712_SimpleBeefStroganoff4x3-3deaf2954c754a2c900ca197a252a241.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\"Top-down view of ground beef stroganoff in a blue skillet\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Snacking in the Kitchen\n\n  Can You Freeze Beef Stroganoff?  \n Unfortunately, cooked egg noodles don't freeze well. If you'd like to freeze this ground beef stroganoff recipe, it's best to prepare it without the noodles. Freeze the beef-sauce mixture in a freezer-safe container for up to three months. Thaw on the stove and stir in cooked egg noodles before serving.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"My family loved this,\" says Amy Stewart. \"I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and added a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix, I think this is what made it so delicious! I also threw in a small can of mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe!\"\n\n\n \"This recipe was quick and easy,\" raves one Allrecipes community member. \"It's a joy to be able to have a nice dinner on the table in about 30 minutes. This is one recipe that I will certainly use again and again.\"\n\n\n \"This was really good,\" says Stephanie LeBlanc. \"I did make a few changes. I doubled the meat on this recipe and then used some beef broth with flour to cut down on the thickness. I also added a can of cream of onion soup to give it additional flavor.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

It was really good. I mainly cook Mexican dishes but my husband is white so I’m exploring new dishes 😊 \n\n \n03\nof 117\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLucyferia Michelle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/06/2024\n\n\n\nOK with tweaks\nI added another can of mushroom soup. Also just cut up some garlic and onion and basically minced it and cooked the beef in that. Used Mini penne because I hate egg noodles. Probably could season the beef a little more though. Other than that it's better than Hamburger Helper. \n\n \n04\nof 117\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nFunkyGrill2578\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n04/14/2024\n\n\n\nMissing something\nIf I were you I wouldn’t put egg noodles in there. I put just plain noodles and it was better. Also it initially doesn’t have enough sauce so I would recommend a block of cream cheese, a little bit of butter, and some onion powder if you are looking for more flavor. Once you add all that it can get a little thick so keep some pasta water and use it as needed. And if you are feeling a little frisky some mozzarella cheese is really good in it too. All in all it was ok as a base recipe but to me the original was bland. \n\n \n05\nof 117\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLiuda corsack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/25/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nEasy to follow \n\n \n06\nof 117\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSara Hill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/28/2024\n\n\n\nNeeds more flavor\nDefinitely simple! It's not bad for my first time!! I'm sure it'll get better with time and touch!

My husband \u0026 I both love stroganoff so we thought we would try this. I made just a couple of changes. I added a little less than half a can of water with the condensed cream of mushroom. I also added a packet of dried mushroom gravy for some extra flavor. The next time, I will probably add 2 packets of gravy instead of 1 \u0026 I will add some extra mushrooms. It made a lot too so it was perfect for leftovers \n\n \n09\nof 117\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nGlitzyRibs8159\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/12/2023\nGood if you want that homemade taste
