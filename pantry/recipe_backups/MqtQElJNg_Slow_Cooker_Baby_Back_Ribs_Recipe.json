They cook in a crockpot until tender, then are covered with barbeque sauce and finished in the oven for fall-apart ribs.

Officially addicted. I used a Santa Maria Rub I found and added a touch of tequila with the water and onions instead of bbq sauce and my husband raved how good they were. Said for me not to change a thing and that they were the best ribs he's ever had. I had tried for 20 years to get that kind of reaction from him, so thank you for this recipe. It only takes about 4 hrs to cook and then I put them in the oven for 30 minutes just for good measure. Melts in your mouth delectably. \n\n \n05\nof 175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nProudTray1602\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/05/2024\nIt’s really good \n\n \n06\nof 175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nRob685\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/23/2023\nFirst time making ribs this way. Always made them slow in the oven would definitely do it this way in the future.Cooked on high for 3-1/2 hours then finished them off sauced in the air fryer for 8 minutes on 375 Perfect.👍 \n\n \n07\nof 175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nRubyBread4580\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/22/2022\nTurned out great!! First time I tried this recipe I cooked them on high for 4 hrs. The ribs turned out great and were falling off the bone, but shrunk a bit. Just made them again on low for 8 hrs. Again, just as tender, falling off the bone, but ribs kept their shape. I'll definitely continue using this recipe. Enjoy!! \n\n \n08\nof 175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nChristine Zyontz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10/19/2022\nBest ribs we have ever had. What an amazing, simple recipe! I cut them into four pieces before cooking. They were in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low and were fall-off-the-bone and so moist. Definitely will be part of our rotation. Good enough to impress company. \n\n \n09\nof 175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nVickie Jones Hendren\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/14/2022\n \n\n \n10\nof 175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto
