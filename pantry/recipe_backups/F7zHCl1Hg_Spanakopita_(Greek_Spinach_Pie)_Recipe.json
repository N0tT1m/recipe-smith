With this top-rated Greek spanakopita recipe, you'll have the most delicious savory pie of your life on the table in just over an hour.\n\n\n  What Is Spanakopita?  \n Spanakopita is a savory Greek pie that consists of a spinach-ricotta filling baked in a buttery phyllo crust.\n\n\n  Spanakopita Pronunciation  \n \"Spanakopita\" is pronounced \"spah-nah-KO-pee-tuh.\"\n\n\n  How to Make Spanakopita  \n You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated spanakopita:\n\n\n  Make the Filling  \n Saute onion, green onions, and garlic in olive oil until they're soft and lightly browned. Add spinach and parsley, then continue to saute until spinach is limp. Remove from heat and let cool. In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, ricotta, and feta. Stir into spinach mixture.\n\n\n  Assemble the Spanakopita  \n Lay one sheet of phyllo dough in a lightly oiled 9x9 inch baking pan. Brush lightly with olive oil. Lay another sheet of phyllo dough on top, brush with olive oil, and repeat this process with two more sheets of phyllo. The sheets will overlap the pan. Spread the spinach and cheese mixture into the pan and fold overhanging dough over filling. Brush with oil, then layer with the remaining sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each with oil. Seal the filling with the overhanging dough.\n\n\n  Bake the Spanakopita  \n Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until golden brown. Cut into squares and serve while it's still hot.\n\n\n  How to Store Spanakopita  \n Store leftover spanakopita in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat in the oven until heated through.\n\n\n  How to Freeze Spanakopita  \n The best way to freeze spanakopita? Freeze it before baking. It won't lose nearly as much flavor or texture this way, as the dish won't be cooked twice. Just assemble the spanakopita, wrap it in one layer or storage wrap and one layer of aluminum foil, then freeze for up to two months. Thaw in the fridge and cook according to the recipe.\n\n\n You can also freeze spanakopita after baking: Simply let the dish cool and transfer it to a freezer-safe container. Freeze for up to two months. Thaw in the fridge and reheat in the oven until heated through.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"My apologies to the purists out there, but I also added fresh basil, chopped asparagus, mushrooms, and artichoke hearts,\" says S'more. \"I have made it with none of the additions, all of the additions, and a combination of the 3 depending on what I had on hand and it always turns out phenomenal!\"\n\n\n \"This is awesome,\" raves Sylvia C. \"We ate the whole thing in 15 minutes. I will probably need to double this next time. I used a 9-oz. bag of pre-washed spinach, chopped, and it turned out great. This would be great with a Greek salad with olives.\"\n\n\n \"I used frozen spinach to save time,\" according to JoAnne Gauthier. \"This was half-thawed and, when added to the hot mixture, it was just the right consistency and temp to keep moving and finish this. Great pie.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

You can place the spinach in a fine sieve or clean cloth and press or squeeze out excess liquid, working over the sink.\n\n\n\n\n\n Mix feta cheese, ricotta cheese, and eggs in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in spinach mixture. Lay one sheet of phyllo dough in the prepared baking pan, and brush lightly with olive oil. Lay another sheet of phyllo dough on top and brush with olive oil. Repeat the process with two more sheets of phyllo dough; the sheets will overlap the pan.\n\n \n\n\n\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/gJNp78JrRF1XgjCDkhWL8rm3_bI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/18417-spanakopita-greek-spinach-pie-DDMFS-Step-05-24921-1-33d9d07dfeaa4d1ca73a800f1eeed6d2.jpg\"\nwidth=\"4000\"\nheight=\"3000\"\nclass=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\"\nsrcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/4r8r5GERj2epm6AQZG-xFOeKaNQ=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/18417-spanakopita-greek-spinach-pie-DDMFS-Step-05-24921-1-33d9d07dfeaa4d1ca73a800f1eeed6d2.jpg 750w\"\nsizes=\"750px\"\nalt=\" Filo dough layers brushed with oil in a baking dish.\"\n/\u003e\n\n \n Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans\n\n Expert Tip\nOur Editorial Director Diana Moutsopoulos likes to sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of semolina flour over the last layer of phyllo before adding the filling. The semolina helps to absorb excess moisture, preventing sogginess and keeping the phyllo cripsy. If you don't have semolina you can use Cream of Wheat.\n\n\n\n\n\n Spread spinach and cheese mixture into the pan. Fold any overhanging dough over the filling.

You can place the spinach in a fine sieve or clean cloth and press or squeeze out excess liquid, working over the sink.;Mix feta cheese, ricotta cheese, and eggs in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in spinach mixture. Lay one sheet of phyllo dough in the prepared baking pan, and brush lightly with olive oil. Lay another sheet of phyllo dough on top and brush with olive oil. Repeat the process with two more sheets of phyllo dough; the sheets will overlap the pan. \u003cimg src=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/gJNp78JrRF1XgjCDkhWL8rm3_bI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/18417-spanakopita-greek-spinach-pie-DDMFS-Step-05-24921-1-33d9d07dfeaa4d1ca73a800f1eeed6d2.jpg\" width=\"4000\" height=\"3000\" class=\"img--noscript mntl-image mntl-image universal-image__image\" srcset=\"https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/4r8r5GERj2epm6AQZG-xFOeKaNQ=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/18417-spanakopita-greek-spinach-pie-DDMFS-Step-05-24921-1-33d9d07dfeaa4d1ca73a800f1eeed6d2.jpg 750w\" sizes=\"750px\" alt=\" Filo dough layers brushed with oil in a baking dish.\" /\u003e Brie Goldman / Food Stylist: Annie Probst / Prop Stylist: Addelyn Evans Expert Tip Our Editorial Director Diana Moutsopoulos likes to sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of semolina flour over the last layer of phyllo before adding the filling. The semolina helps to absorb excess moisture, preventing sogginess and keeping the phyllo cripsy. If you don't have semolina you can use Cream of Wheat.;Spread spinach and cheese mixture into the pan. Fold any overhanging dough over the filling.
