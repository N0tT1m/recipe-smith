I trippled the recipe. I used boneless pork chops. I didnt have any Green Onions so I improvised by useing fresh Chives from our garden. I did not need to fry the pork in the oil for ten mins. four to five mins. did fine. I think ten mins. would have burnt them. I tested the largest pieces with a meat thermometer to make sure. It registerd a fast 179° F. I didn't have any cornstarch left for the thickening in the end, so I replaced it with the equal amount of gluten-free flour. It worked just fine. I used some of the liquid from the pot to mix into the gluten-free flour first so there wouldn't be any lumps.I also replaced 1/3 of the Apple Cider Vinegar with Distilled White Vinegar cause I didn't have enough of that either. That had a little bit of a negative effect.... but not too bad. Would definitely recommend only using Apple Cider Vinegar though. Probably could cut back on the sugar some. It was quite sweet, but not extremely. \n\n \n08\nof 210\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nsbiamonte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/26/2023\nOh my gosh, better than my favorite Chinese restaurant!!! I am almost 77 and never ventured to do this before. I am pooped. I added carrots and peppers, But I did sit on a stool to do most of this. Holy moly, lots of cleanup, but well worth it I'll tell you. Wow and I didn't have to pay 45.00 for a meal this was awesome.
