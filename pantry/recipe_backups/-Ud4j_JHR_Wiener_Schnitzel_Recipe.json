For instance: \n\n\n\nAuthentic German Potato Salad\nGurkensalat (German Cucumber Salad)\nGerman Potato Dumplings (Kartoffelkloesse) \n\n\n Explore our entire collection of German Recipes for delicious inspiration. \n\n\n  How to Store Wiener Schnitzel  \n Store your leftover wiener schnitzel in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. Reheat in the oven or on the stove for the best results. \n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n “I couldn't find veal so I've made this with pork loin,” says one Allrecipes community member.“Great recipe! The parsley and Parmesan make it really tasty.”\n\n\n “This was so delicious I can't wait to make it again,” raves Cathie Long. “Cooking it in the butter was like the best thing ever created. It was so delicious. I served mine with some pickled red cabbage on the side and some lemons. It was great.\n\n\n “I LOVE this recipe,” says EDDIE VALLEE. “My family loves this recipe! We can't make enough of it! I also use the breading/batter mix with other meats like chicken, fish, and have made country-fried steak with it.

We lived in West Germany when we first got married, after I did my tour in Viet Nam as a chopper pilot. I continued flying in West Germany. We had a great restaurant in Munich where the owner loved GI's and I'd humor him by wearing my Army uniform, that I never wore off-base except for our weekly trip to see him. I always ate his veal dishes made special for us. A wonderful memory from 55 years ago. All thanks to this wonderful Wiener Schnitzel. I'm getting ready to eat it again! No effort at all! It's hard to buy veal where I live but I drove to Whole Foods and it was well worth the extra effort.
