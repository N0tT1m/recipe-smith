This top-rated, crowd-pleasing recipe is beloved by the Allrecipes community. Plus, it comes together with just five basic ingredients you probably already have on hand. You can't ask for much more than that, folks.\n\n\n  What Is Chicken and Dumplings?  \n Chicken and dumplings is a soup-like dish that consists of chicken, a thick broth, and dumplings made out of biscuit dough. The iconic comfort food is filling, made with cheap ingredients, and deliciously cozy.\n\n\n  Chicken and Dumplings Ingredients  \n Here's what you'll need to make incredibly easy slow cooker chicken and dumplings:\n\n\n ChickenOpt for boneless, skinless chicken breast halves.\n\n\n ButterButter adds creaminess and richness to this comforting meal.\n\n\n Canned SoupTwo cans of condensed cream of chicken soup make this Crock-Pot chicken and dumplings recipe quick and easy to throw together.\n\n\n OnionKick the flavor up a notch with a diced onion. As the chicken and dumplings cook, the flavor will deepen.\n\n\n Refrigerated Biscuit DoughInstead of making homemade dumplings, try using refrigerated biscuit dough for a convenient shortcut.\n\n\n  How to Make Chicken and Dumplings in a Slow Cooker  \n It couldn't be easier to make chicken and dumplings in a slow cooker. Basically, you'll just add the chicken, butter, soup, and onion to a crockpot and cook on high for about five or six hours. Add shredded biscuit dough about 30 minutes before serving. Let the dough cook in the soup until it's no longer raw.\n\n\n We think this dish is delicious on its own, but some reviewers say they like to add a little flavor with spices and seasonings they have on hand, such as paprika and garlic. This recipe is easily customizable, so spice it up however you please.\n\n\n  How to Store Chicken and Dumplings  \n Let chicken and dumplings cool completely before packing away for storage. Place in an airtight container and store in the fridge for up to five days. Reheat in the microwave, on the stove, or in the oven.\n\n\n  Can You Freeze Chicken and Dumplings?  \n Yes, you can freeze chicken and dumplings. Allow the dish to cool completely, then remove the dumplings and place them in a freezer-safe container or zip-top bag. Place the remaining chicken and soup into a separate freezer-safe storage container or zip-top bag.\n\n\n When you're ready to eat, put the chicken and soup in a pot on the stove. Bring to a boil. In the meantime, thaw the dumplings (in the storage container) in warm water.\n\n\n Add the thawed dumplings to the boiling mixture, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 10 to 15 more minutes before serving.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \"Easy and cheap to make,\" says Georgia Girl. \"The recipe is full of flavor as written, but easy to tweak for personal tastes. I used chicken broth instead of water and some basic seasoning (cumin, poultry seasoning, all-purpose seasoning, and fresh cracked black pepper) as I read in other reviews.\"\n\n\n \"This recipe is awesome,\" raves suechef29. \"I have two picky eaters and they both love this meal. It's so nice to come home after work to a great tasting meal that was so easy to make!\"\n\n\n \"This was so good and so easy,\" according to savantsrn. \"Tastes like the from-scratch version that my grandmother always made. I added carrots and creamed corn to the mix and it turned out wonderful.\"\n\n\n Editorial contributions by Corey Williams\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCook Mode\n(Keep screen awake)\n\nIngredients\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4x\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOops!

Added oregano, rosemary, paprika, salt \u0026 pepper, which made it flavorful. My chicken breast was thinner, so the cook time was only 3-4 hours.I flattened the biscuits and cut them into smaller pieces, and added them 30 minutes before serving, and they were more doughy than i would've liked. I also recommend adding more chicken, if you're serving more than 2 people.TLDR-- nice and easy recipe! minor tweaks can make it great. \n\n \n04\nof 401\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nCurtiss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n07/22/2024\nWith tweaks: I added a small bag of frozen peas, corn, carrots, and beans; a cup of chopped celery, a tsp kosher salt, tsp of course pepper, and half tsp cayenne (cause I likah da heat). I also used about 3 lbs of chicken thighs instead because I prefer dark meat. Flattened the biscuits some (not too much) per recommendation from previous comments. Bam!!!

I couldn't believe there were zero spices listed (how bland would THAT be) so I used a little salt \u0026 pepper and garlic directly on the chicken as I layered it into the bottom of the crockpot. My husband has to watch his fat intake so I used 1 can of reg cream of chicken and 1 can of 98% fat free cream of chicken and used broth instead of water. I further seasoned the mixture with a little tarragon, rosemary and paprika. (I saw that a lot of people added mixed veggies but I wanted good old fashioned chicken and dumplings and not a pot pie so I didn't go that far.) I served it with rice and roasted brussels sprouts.I used the thin sliced chicken breasts and didn't want to overcook them but I was also concerned about the biscuits being doughy and undercooked per some of the reviews I read so I pulled them apart and added them at 4 hours and cooked them for 1 hour for a total of 5 hours. Everything was perfectly cooked and my family approved it to try it again. But I think next time I might try to sub Bisquick for more of a drop type dumpling.This recipe was easy but I only gave it 4 stars because there really should have been some sort of seasoning included in the ingredients and also because I kept comparing it in my mind to my moms homemade chicken and dumplings which would def get 5 stars.😉😆 \n\n \n07\nof 401\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMaria Cartagena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/17/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nWorth the effort\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\nThis is an easy receipe to follow.
