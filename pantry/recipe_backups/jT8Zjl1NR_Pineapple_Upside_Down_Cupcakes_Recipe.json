Delicious but very sticky--need a fork to eat. very easy to make. used silicone pans so it came out very easily. Oh I had to use vanilla cake mix because store didn't have pineapple and whenever I use a cake mix I replace the oil with melted butter. \n\n \n03\nof 148\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nJennifer Johnson Morgan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/04/2024\nI think the brown sugar amount could be lessened to 2 teaspoons instead of 1 tablespoon since quite a bit was left in the cups after taking them out. I used cut pineapple pieces instead to make it prettier. Also the amount of batter didn’t fully fill each cup of my 24 cup pan. 2 cakes are actually shorter since I had to split the little bit of batter that was left. They have great taste and are also fluffy. Would make again with my tweaks! \n\n \n04\nof 148\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLaura Brooks Houck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05/10/2024\nImpressed by how easy it was \n\n \n05\nof 148\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLimeBao8504\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/18/2024\nNice and easy \n\n \n06\nof 148\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nSereneTray7014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/09/2023\nCame out perfect.

I used the juice in the cake mix. I made 6 giant and 12 regular cupcakes. \n\n \n08\nof 148\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nClassyBoba7255\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/05/2023\nLove this recipe! I did use mostly the ring pineapple cut into 7 sections so I could form it on the bottom of the cupcake liner. I was a little low on the pineapple juice so I just added crushed pineapple until it got to the amount recommended. I also went bigger and used the premium baking liners. Today is my mother-in-laws 94th birthday so I am bringing them to her and the ladies that she has lunch with.
