Super fun and easy to incorporate lots of veggies (especially if you have picky eater kids). I added extra veggies like broccoli, cauliflower and green onions. Cooked veggie meat with loads of spices like basil, turmeric (the Indian in me just had to haha), chili powder, paprika etc. My boyfriend and I loveeee cheese so I added extra. Added chia seeds for extra fibre! Highly recommend making these. Thought I would have extras but looks like they’re all gone haha \n\n \n05\nof 186\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nLiane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n08/31/2023\nI’m a short order cook who works breakfast shift and I was tired of eating the same scrambled eggs every day! I used bacon instead of sausage,mushroom instead of onion and added more pepper than the recipe calls for. I also mixed the bacon ,cheese and mushroom together and spooned into the bottom of the pan first and then poured the egg and spice mixture over and covered with some extra cheese. I went for a cook time right in the middle of 22 minutes. They turned out perfect. Just grease the pan liberally and you shouldn’t have any issues. The freeze beautifully! Will definitely use this recipe often! \n\n \n06\nof 186\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n03/06/2023\nI really liked these! I did heed the reviews, and added a little extra seasoning, also, I used turkey sausage, which required seasoning. Drawback- I greased my pans, and muffins still stuck! One pan was nonstick, I did grease it as well, but not as carefully, some actually fell out of pan, but not all! \n\n \n07\nof 186\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMatureDip3305\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n01/21/2023\nNo peppers added ..
