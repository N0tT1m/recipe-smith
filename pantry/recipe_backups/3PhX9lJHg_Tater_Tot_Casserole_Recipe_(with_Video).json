I think my mom used to make this, but she added a soup can of milk to the mixture. \n\n \n07\nof 133\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nCordale Montgomery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11/13/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nGreat flavors\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\nFor all the single folks out there, the recipe instructions are quick and easy. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves ground beef and Tater Tots. I got a little creative and added a medley of onions, green peppers, and red peppers to ground beef. ooo la la... \n\n \n08\nof 133\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nAngie Lindsey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n09/01/2024\n\n\n\nOK with tweaks\nI added onions, celery, peppers and garlic when sauteing the meat. I added corn as suggested and spread cheese over the casserole before adding the tater tots and then again over the top. To me I found it a bit boring. Very Midwest. My husband LOVED it.... \n\n \n09\nof 133\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by \nMona Linda Villegas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06/02/2024\n\n\n\nA keeper!\n\n\n\nEasy to follow\n\n\n\nFamily favorite\nMy kids love this dish.

I prefer that over the shredded cheese, how it's more creamy, finally sprinkle with a dash season salt and black pepper. \n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
